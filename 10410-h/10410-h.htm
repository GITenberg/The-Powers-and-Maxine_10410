<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>LISA'S KNIGHT AND LISA'S SISTER</h3>
<p>It had come at last, the moment I had been thinking about for
days. I was going to have him all to myself, the only person in the
world I ever loved.</p>
<p>He had asked me to sit out two dances, and that made me think he
really must want to be with me, not just because I'm the "pretty
girl's sister," but because I'm myself, Lisa Drummond.</p>
<p>Being what I am,&mdash;queer, and plain, I can't bear to think
that men like girls for their beauty; yet I can't help liking men
better if they are handsome.</p>
<p>I don't know if Ivor Dundas is the handsomest man I ever saw,
but he seems so to me. I don't know if he is very good, or really
very wonderful, although he's clever and ambitious enough; but he
has a way that makes women fond of him; and men admire him, too. He
looks straight into your eyes when he talks to you, as if he cared
more for you than anyone else in the world: and if I were an
artist, painting a picture of a dark young knight starting off for
the crusades, I should ask Ivor Dundas to stand as my model.</p>
<p>Perhaps his expression wouldn't be exactly right for the pious
young crusader, for it isn't at all saintly, really: still, I have
seen just that rapt sort of look on his face. It was generally when
he was talking to Di: but I wouldn't let myself believe that it
meant anything in particular. He has the reputation of having made
lots of women fall in love with him. This was one of the first
things I heard when Di and I came over from America to visit Lord
and Lady Mountstuart. And of course there was the story about him
and Maxine de Renzie. Everyone was talking of it when we first
arrived in London.</p>
<p>My heart beat very fast as I guided him into the room which Lady
Mountstuart has given Di and me for our special den. It is
separated by another larger room from the ballroom; but both doors
were open and we could see people dancing.</p>
<p>I told him he might sit by me on the sofa under Di's book
shelves, because we could talk better there. Usually, I don't like
being in front of a mirror, because&mdash;well, because I'm only
the "pretty girl's sister." But to-night I didn't mind. My cheeks
were red, and my eyes bright. Sitting down, you might almost take
me for a tall girl, and the way my gown was made didn't show that
one shoulder is a little higher than the other. Di designed the
dress.</p>
<p>I thought, if I wasn't pretty, I did look interesting, and
original. I looked as if I could <i>think</i> of things; and as if
I could feel.</p>
<p>And I was feeling. I was wondering why he had been so good to me
lately, unless he cared. Of course it might be for Di's sake; but I
am not so queer-looking that no man could ever be fascinated by
me.</p>
<p>They say pity is akin to love. Perhaps he had begun by pitying
me, because Di has everything and I nothing; and then, afterwards,
he had found out that I was intelligent and sympathetic.</p>
<p>He sat by me and didn't speak at first. Just then Di passed the
far-away, open door of the ballroom, dancing with Lord Robert West,
the Duke of Glasgow's brother.</p>
<p>"Thank you so much for the book," I said.</p>
<p>(He had sent me a book that morning&mdash;one he'd heard me say
I wanted.)</p>
<p>He didn't seem to hear, and then he turned suddenly, with one of
his nice smiles. I always think he has the nicest smile in the
world: and certainly he has the nicest voice. His eyes looked very
kind, and a little sad. I willed him hard to love me.</p>
<p>"It made me happy to get it," I went on.</p>
<p>"It made me happy to send it," he said.</p>
<p>"Does it please you to do things for me?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Why, of course."</p>
<p>"You do like poor little me a tiny bit, then?" I couldn't help
adding&mdash;"Even though I'm different from other girls?"</p>
<p>"Perhaps more for that reason," he said, with his voice as kind
as his eyes.</p>
<p>"Oh, what shall I do if you go away!" I burst out, partly
because I really meant it, and partly because I hoped it might lead
him on to say what I wanted so much to hear. "Suppose you get that
consulship at Algiers."</p>
<p>"I hope I may," he said quickly. "A consulship isn't a very
great thing&mdash;but&mdash;it's a beginning. I want it badly."</p>
<p>"I wish I had some influence with the Foreign Secretary," said
I, not telling him that the man actually dislikes me, and looks at
me as if I were a toad. "Of course, he's Lord Mountstuart's cousin,
and brother-in-law as well, and that makes him seem quite in the
family, doesn't it? But it isn't as if I were really related to
Lady Mountstuart. I was never sorry before that Di and I are only
step-sisters&mdash;no, not a bit sorry, though her mother had all
the money, and brought it to my poor father; but now I wish I were
Lady Mountstuart's niece, and that I had some of the coaxing,
'girly' ways Di can put on when she wants to get something out of
people. I'd make the Foreign Secretary give you exactly what you
wanted, even if it took you far, far from me."</p>
<p>With that, he looked at me suddenly, and his face grew slowly
red, under the brown.</p>
<p>"You are a very kind Imp," he said. "Imp" is the name he
invented for me. I loved to hear him call me by it.</p>
<p>"Kind!" I echoed. "One isn't kind when
one&mdash;likes&mdash;people."</p>
<p>I saw by his eyes, then, that he knew. But I didn't care. If
only I could make him say the words I longed to hear&mdash;even
because he pitied me, because he had found out how I loved him, and
because he had really too much of the dark-young-Crusader-knight in
him, to break my heart! I made up my mind that I would take him at
his word, quickly, if he gave me the chance; and I would tell Di
that he was dreadfully in love with me. That would make her
writhe.</p>
<p>I kept my eyes on him, and I let them tell him everything. He
saw; there was no doubt of that; but he did not say the words I
hoped for. A moment or two he was silent; and then, gazing away
towards the door of the ballroom, he spoke very gently, as if I had
been a child&mdash;though I am older than Di by three or four
years.</p>
<p>"Thank you, Imp, for letting me see that you are such a staunch
little friend," said he. "Now that I know you really do take an
interest in my affairs, I think I may tell you why I want so much
to go to Algiers&mdash;though very likely you've guessed
already&mdash;you are such an 'intuitive' girl. And besides, I
haven't tried very hard to hide my feelings&mdash;not as hard as I
ought, perhaps, when I realise how little I have to offer to your
sister. Now you understand all, don't you&mdash;even if you didn't
before? I love her, and if I go to Algiers&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Don't say any more," I managed to cut him short. "I can't
bear&mdash;I mean, I understand. I&mdash;did guess before."</p>
<p>It was true. I had guessed, but I wouldn't let myself believe. I
hoped against hope. He was so much kinder to me than any other man
ever took the trouble to be, in all my wretched, embittered
twenty-four years of life.</p>
<p>"Di might have told me," I went gasping on, rather than let
there be a long silence between us just then. I had enough pride
not to want him to see me cry&mdash;though, if it could have made
any difference, I would have grovelled at his feet and wet them
with my tears. "But she never does tell me anything about
herself."</p>
<p>"She's so unselfish and so fond of you, that probably she likes
better to talk about you instead," he defended her. And then I felt
that I could hate him, as much as I've always hated Di, deep down
in my heart. At that minute I should have liked to kill her, and
watch his face when he found her lying dead&mdash;out of his reach
for ever.</p>
<p>"Besides," he hurried on, "I've never asked her yet if she would
marry me, because&mdash;my prospects weren't very brilliant. She
knows of course that I love her&mdash;"</p>
<p>"And if you get the consulship, you'll put the important
question?" I cut him short, trying to be flippant.</p>
<p>"Yes. But I told you tonight, because I&mdash;because you were
so kind, I felt I should like to have you know."</p>
<p>Kind! Yes, I had been too kind. But if by putting out my foot I
could have crushed every hope of his for the future&mdash;every
hope, that is, in which my stepsister Diana Forrest had any
part&mdash;I would have done it, just as I trample on ants in the
country sometimes, for the pleasure of feeling that I&mdash;even
I&mdash;have power of life and death.</p>
<p>I swallowed hard, to keep the sobs back. I'm never very strong
or well, but now I felt broken, ready to die. I was glad when I
heard the music stop in the ballroom.</p>
<p>"There!" I said. "The two dances you asked me to sit out with
you are over. I'm sure you're engaged for the next."</p>
<p>"Yes, Imp, I am."</p>
<p>"To Di?"</p>
<p>"No, I have Number 13 with her."</p>
<p>"Thirteen! Unlucky number."</p>
<p>"Any number is lucky that gives me a chance with her. The next
one, coming now, is with Mrs. George Allendale."</p>
<p>"Oh, yes, the actor manager's wife. She goes everywhere; and
Lord Mountstuart likes theatrical celebrities. This house ought to
be very serious and political, but we have every sort of
creature&mdash;provided it's an amusing, or successful, or
good-looking one. By the way, used Maxine de Renzie to come here,
when she was acting in London at George Allendale's theatre? That
was before Di and I arrived on the scene, you remember."</p>
<p>"I remember. Oh, yes, she came here. It was in this house I met
her first, off the stage, I believe."</p>
<p>"What a sweet memory! Wasn't Mrs. George awfully jealous of her
husband when he had such a fascinating beauty for his leading
lady?"</p>
<p>"I never heard that she was."</p>
<p>"You needn't look cross with me. I'm not saying anything against
your gorgeous Maxine."</p>
<p>"Of course not. Nobody could. But you mustn't call Miss de
Renzie 'my Maxine,' please, Imp."</p>
<p>"I beg your pardon," I said. "You see, I've heard other people
call her that&mdash;in joke. And you dedicated your book about
Lhassa, that made you such a famous person, to her, didn't
you?"</p>
<p>"No. What made you think that?" He was really annoyed now, and I
was pleased&mdash;if anything could please me, in my despair.</p>
<p>"Why, everybody thinks it. It was dedicated to 'M.R.' as if the
name were a secret, so&mdash;"</p>
<p>"'Everybody' is very stupid then. 'M.R.' is an old lady, my
god-mother, who helped me with money for my expedition to Lhassa,
otherwise I couldn't have gone. And she isn't of the kind that
likes to see her name in print. Now, where shall I take you, Imp?
Because I must go and look for Mrs. Allendale."</p>
<p>"I'll stay where I am, thank you," I said, "and watch you
dance&mdash;from far off. That's my part in life, you know:
watching other people dance from far off."</p>
<p>When he was gone, I leaned back among the cushions, and I wasn't
sure that one of my heart attacks would not come on. I felt
horribly alone, and deserted; and though I hate Di, and always have
hated her, ever since the tiny child and her mother (a beautiful,
rich, young Californian widow) came into my father's house in New
York, she does know how to manage me better than anyone else, when
I am in such moods. I could have screamed for her, as I sat there
helplessly looking through the open doors: and then, at last, I saw
her, as if my wish had been a call which had reached her ears over
the music in the ballroom.</p>
<p>She had stopped dancing, and with her partner (Lord Robert,
again) entered the room which lay between our "den" and the
ballroom, Probably they would have gone on to the conservatory,
which can be reached in that way, but I cried her name as loudly as
I could, and she heard. Only a moment she paused&mdash;long enough
to send Lord Robert away&mdash;and then she came straight to me. He
must have been furious: but I didn't care for that.</p>
<p>I had been wanting her badly, but when I saw her, so bright and
beautiful, looking as if she were the joy of life made incarnate, I
should have liked to strike her hard, first on one cheek and then
the other, deepening the rose to crimson, and leaving an ugly red
mark for each finger.</p>
<p>"Have you a headache, dear?" she asked, in that velvet voice she
keeps for me&mdash;as if I were a thing only fit for pity and
protection.</p>
<p>"It's my heart," said I. "It feels like a clock running down.
Oh, I wish I could die, and end it all! What's the good of
me&mdash;to myself or anyone?"</p>
<p>"Don't talk like that, my poor one," she said. "Shall I take you
upstairs to your own room?"</p>
<p>"No, I think I should faint if I had to go upstairs," I
answered. "Yet I can't stay here. What shall I do?"</p>
<p>"What about Uncle Eric's study?" Di asked. She always calls Lord
Mountstuart 'Uncle Eric,' though he isn't her uncle. Her mother and
his wife were sisters, that's all: and then there was the other
sister who married the British Secretary for Foreign Affairs, a
cousin of Lord Mountstuart's. That family seemed to have a craze
for American girls; but Lord Mountstuart makes an exception of me.
He's civil, of course, because he's an abject slave of Di's, and
she refused to come and pay a visit in England without me: but I
give him the shivers, I know very well: and I take an impish joy in
making him jump.</p>
<p>"I'm sure he won't be there this evening," Di went on, when I
hesitated. "He's playing bridge with a lot of dear old boys in the
library, or was, half an hour ago. Come, let me help you there.
It's only a step."</p>
<p>She put her pretty arm round my waist, and leaning on her I
walked across the room, out into a corridor, through a tiny
"bookroom" where odd volumes and old magazines are kept, into Lord
Mountstuart's study.</p>
<p>It is a nice room, which he uses much as his wife uses her
boudoir. The library next door is rather a show place, but the
study has only Lord Mountstuart's favourite books in it. He writes
there (he has written a novel or two, and thinks himself literary),
and some pictures he has painted in different parts of the world
hang on the walls: for he also fancies himself artistic.</p>
<p>In one corner is a particularly comfortable, cushiony lounge
where, I suppose, the distinguished author lies and thinks out his
subjects, or dreams them out. And it was to this that Di led
me.</p>
<p>She settled me among some fat pillows of old purple and gold
brocade, and asked if she should ring and get a little brandy.</p>
<p>"No," I said, "I shall feel better in a few minutes. It's so
nice and cool here."</p>
<p>"You look better already!" exclaimed Di. "Soon, when you've lain
and rested awhile, you'll be a different girl."</p>
<p>"Ah, how I wish I <i>could</i> be a different girl!" I sighed.
"A strong, well girl, and tall and beautiful, and admired by
everyone,&mdash;like you&mdash;or Maxine de Renzie."</p>
<p>"What makes you think of her?" asked Di, quickly.</p>
<p>"Ivor was just talking to me of her. You know he calls me his
'pal,' and tells me things he doesn't tell everybody. He thinks a
great deal about Maxine, still."</p>
<p>"She'd be a difficult woman to forget, if she's as attractive
off the stage as she is on."</p>
<p>"What a pity we didn't come in time to meet here when she was
playing in London with George Allendale. Everybody used to invite
her to their houses, it seems. Ivor was telling me that he first
met her here, and that it's such a pleasant memory, whenever he
comes to this house. I suppose that's one reason he likes to come
so much."</p>
<p>"No doubt," said Di sharply.</p>
<p>"He got so fascinated talking of her," I went on. "He almost
forgot that he had a dance with Mrs. Allendale. Of course Maxine
had made a great hit, and all that; but she didn't stand quite as
high as she does now, since she's become the fashion in Paris.
Perhaps she had nothing except her salary, then, whereas she must
have saved up a lot of money by this time. I have an idea that Ivor
would have proposed to her when she was in London if he'd thought
her success established."</p>
<p>"Nonsense!" Di broke out, her cheeks very pink. "As if Ivor were
the kind of man to think of such a thing!"</p>
<p>"He isn't very rich, and he is very ambitious. It would be bad
for him to marry a poor girl, or a girl who wasn't well connected
socially. He <i>has</i> to think of such things."</p>
<p>I watched the effect of these words, with my eyes half shut; for
of course Di has all her mother's money, two hundred thousand
English pounds; and through the Mountstuarts, and her aunt who is
married to the Foreign Secretary, she has got to know all the best
people in England. Besides, the King and Queen have been
particularly nice to her since she was presented, so she has the
run of their special set, as well as the political and artistic,
and "old-fashioned exclusive" ones.</p>
<p>"Ivor Dundas is a law unto himself," she said, "and he has
plenty of good connections of his own. He'll have a little money,
too, some day, from an aunt or a god-mother, I believe. Anyway, he
and Miss de Renzie had nothing more than a flirtation. Aunt Lilian
told me so. She said Maxine was rather proud to have Ivor dangling
about, because everyone likes him, and because his travels and his
book were being a lot talked about just then. Naturally, he admired
her, because she's beautiful, and a very great actress&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Oh, your Aunt Lilian would make little of the affair," I
laughed. "She flirts with him herself."</p>
<p>"Why, Lisa, Aunt Lilian's over forty, and he's twenty-nine!"</p>
<p>"Forty isn't the end of the world for a woman, nowadays. She's a
beauty and a great lady. Ivor always wants the best of everything.
She flirts with him, and he with her."</p>
<p>Di laughed too, but only to make it seem as if she didn't care.
"You'd better not say such silly things to Uncle Eric," she said,
staring at the pattern of the cornice. "Aren't those funny,
gargoyley faces up there? I never noticed them before. But
oh&mdash;about Mr. Dundas and Maxine de Renzie&mdash;I don't think,
really, that he troubles himself much about her any more, for the
other day I&mdash;I happened to ask what she was playing in Paris
now, and he didn't know. He said he hadn't been over to see her
act, as it was too far away, and he was afraid when he wasn't too
busy, he was too lazy."</p>
<p>"He <i>said</i> so to you, of course. But when he spends
Saturday to Monday at Folkestone with the godmother who's going to
leave him her money, how easy to slip over the Channel to the fair
Maxine, without anyone being the wiser."</p>
<p>"Why shouldn't he slip, or slide, or steam, or sail in a
balloon, if he likes?" laughed Di, but not happily. "You're looking
much better, Lisa. You've quite a colour now. Do you feel strong
enough to go upstairs?"</p>
<p>"I would rather rest here for awhile, since you think Lord
Mountstuart is sure not to come," said I. "These pillows are so
comfortable. Then perhaps, by and by, I shall feel able to go back
to the den, and watch the dancing. I should like to keep up, if I
can, for I know I shan't sleep, and the night will seem so
long."</p>
<p>"Very well," said Di, speaking kindly, though I knew she would
have liked to shake me. "I'm afraid I shall have to run away now,
for my partner will think me so rude. What about supper?"</p>
<p>"Oh, I don't want any. And I shall have gone upstairs before
that," I interrupted. "Go now, I don't need you any more."</p>
<p>"Ring, and send for me if you feel badly again."</p>
<p>"Yes&mdash;yes."</p>
<p>By this time she was at the door, and there she turned with a
remorseful look in her eyes, as if she had been unkind and was
sorry. "Even if you don't send, I shall come back by and by, when I
can, to see how you are," she said. Then she was gone, and I
nestled deeper into the sofa cushions, with the feeling that my
head was so heavy, it must weigh down the pillows like a stone.</p>
<p>"She was afraid of missing Number 13 with Ivor," I said to
myself. "Well&mdash;she's welcome to it now. I don't think she'll
enjoy it much&mdash;or let him. Oh, I hope they'll quarrel. I don't
think I'd mind anything, if only I was sure they'd never be nearer
to each other. I wish Di would marry Lord Robert. Perhaps then Ivor
would turn to me. Oh, my God, how I hate her&mdash;and all
beautiful girls, who spoil the lives of women like me."</p>
<p>A shivering fit shook me from head to feet, as I guessed that
the time must be coming for Number 13. They were together, perhaps.
What if, in spite of all, Ivor should tell Di how he loved her, and
they should be engaged? At that thought, I tried to bring on a
heart attack, and die; for at least it would chill their happiness
if, when Lady Mountstuart's ball was over, I should be found lying
white and dead, like Elaine on her barge. I was holding my breath,
with my hand pressed over my heart to feel how it was beating, when
the door opened suddenly, and I heard a voice speaking.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>LISA LISTENS</h3>
<p>Someone turned up the light. "I'll leave you together," said
Lord Mountstuart; and the door was closed.</p>
<p>"What could that mean?" I wondered. I had supposed the two men
had come in alone, but there must have been a third person. Who
could it be? Had Lord Mountstuart been arranging a
t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te between Di and Ivor Dundas?</p>
<p>The thought was like a hand on my throat, choking my life out. I
must hear what they had to say to each other.</p>
<p>Without stopping to think more, I rolled over and let myself
sink down into the narrow space between the low couch and the wall,
sharply pulling the clinging folds of my chiffon dress after me.
Then I lay still, my blood pounding in my temples and ears, and in
my nostrils a faint, musty smell from the Oriental stuff that
covered the lounge.</p>
<p>I could see nothing from where I lay, except the side of the
couch, the wall, and a bit of the ceiling with the gargoyley
cornice which Di had mentioned when she wanted to seem indifferent
to the subject of our conversation. But I was listening with all my
might for what was to come.</p>
<p>"Better lock the door, if you please, Dundas," said a voice,
which gave me a shock of surprise, though I knew it well.</p>
<p>Instead of Di, it was the Foreign Secretary who spoke.</p>
<p>"We won't run the risk of interruptions," he went on, with that
slow, clear enunciation of his which most Oxford men have, and keep
all their lives, especially men of the college that was
his&mdash;Balliol. "I told Mountstuart that I wanted a private chat
with you. Beyond that, he knows nothing, nor does anyone else
except myself. You understand that this conversation of ours,
whether anything comes of it or not, is entirely confidential. I
have a proposal to make. You'll agree to it or not, as you choose.
But if you don't agree, forget it, with everything I may have
said."</p>
<p>"My services and my memory are both at your disposal," answered
Ivor, in such a gay, happy voice that something told me he had
already talked with Diana&mdash;and that in spite of me she had not
snubbed him. "I am honoured&mdash;I won't say flattered, for I'm
too much in earnest&mdash;that you should place any confidence in
me."</p>
<p>I lay there behind the lounge and sneered at this speech of his.
Of course, I said to myself, he would be ready to do anything to
please the Foreign Secretary, since all the big plums his ambition
craved were in the gift of that man.</p>
<p>"Frankly, I'm in a difficulty, and it has occurred to me that
you can help me out of it better than anyone else I know," said the
smooth, trained voice. "It is a little diplomatic errand you will
have to undertake for me tomorrow, if you want to do me a good
turn."</p>
<p>"I will undertake it with great pleasure, and carry it through
to the best of my ability," replied Ivor.</p>
<p>"I'm sure you can carry it through excellently," said the
Foreign Secretary, still fencing. "It will be good practice, if you
succeed, for&mdash;any future duties in the career which may be
opening to you."</p>
<p>"He's bribing him with that consulship," I thought, beginning to
be very curious indeed as to what I might be going to hear. My
heart wasn't beating so thickly now. I could think almost calmly
again.</p>
<p>"I thank you for your trust in me," said Ivor.</p>
<p>"A little diplomatic errand," repeated the Foreign Secretary.
"In itself the thing is not much: that is, on the face of it. And
yet, in its relation with other interests, it becomes a mission of
vast importance, incalculable importance. When I have explained,
you will see why I apply to you. Indeed, I came to my cousin
Mountstuart's house expressly because I was told you would be at
his wife's ball. My regret is, that the news which brought me in
search of you didn't reach me earlier, for if it had I should have
come with my wife, and have got at you in time to send you
off&mdash;if you agreed to go&mdash;to-night. As it is, the matter
will have to rest till to-morrow morning. It's too late for you to
catch the midnight boat across the Channel."</p>
<p>"Across the Channel?" echoed Ivor. "You want me to go to
France?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"One could always get across somehow," said Ivor, thoughtfully,
"if there were a great hurry."</p>
<p>"There is&mdash;the greatest. But in this case, the more haste,
the less speed. That is, if you were to rush off, order a special
train, and charter a tug or motor boat at Dover, as I suppose you
mean, my object would probably be defeated. I came to you because
those who are watching this business wouldn't be likely to guess I
had given you a hand in it. All that you do, however, must be done
quietly, with no fuss, no sign of anything unusual going on. It was
natural I should come to a ball given by my wife's sister, whose
husband is my cousin. No one knows of this interview of ours: I
believe I may make my mind easy on that score, at least. And it is
equally natural that you should start on business or pleasure of
your own, for Paris to-morrow morning; also that you should meet
Mademoiselle de Renzie there."</p>
<p>"Mademoiselle de Renzie!" exclaimed Ivor, off his guard for an
instant, and showing plainly that he was taken aback.</p>
<p>"Isn't she a friend of yours?" asked the Foreign Secretary
rather sharply. Though I couldn't see him, I knew exactly how he
would be looking at Ivor, his keen grey eyes narrowed, his
clean-shaven lips drawn in, the long, well-shaped hand, of which he
is said to be vain, toying with the pale Malmaison pink he always
wears in his buttonhole.</p>
<p>"Yes, she is a friend of mine," Ivor answered. "But&mdash;"</p>
<p>"A 'but' already! Perhaps I'd better tell you that the mission
has to do with Mademoiselle de Renzie, and, directly, with no one
else. She has acted as my agent in Paris."</p>
<p>"Indeed! I didn't dream that she dabbled in politics."</p>
<p>"And you should not dream it from any word of mine, Mr. Dundas,
if it weren't necessary to be entirely open with you, if you are to
help me in this matter. But before we go any further, I must know
whether Mademoiselle de Renzie's connection with this business will
for any reason keep you out of it."</p>
<p>"Not if&mdash;you need my help," said Ivor, with an effort. "And
I beg you won't suppose that my hesitation has anything to do with
Miss de Renzie herself. I have for her the greatest respect and
admiration."</p>
<p>"We all have," returned the Foreign Secretary, "especially those
who know her best. Among her many virtues, she's one of the few
women who can keep a secret&mdash;her own and others. She is a
magnificent actress&mdash;on the stage and off. And now I have your
promise to help me, I must tell you it's to help her as well:
therefore I owe you the whole truth, or you will be handicapped.
For several years Mademoiselle de Renzie has done good
service&mdash;secret service, you must understand&mdash;for Great
Britain."</p>
<p>"By Jove! Maxine a political spy!" Ivor broke out
impulsively.</p>
<p>"That's rather a hard name, isn't it? There are better ones. And
she's no traitor to her country, because, as you perhaps know,
she's Polish by birth. I can assure you we've much for which to
thank her cleverness and tact&mdash;and beauty. For our sakes I'm
sorry that she's serving our interests professionally for the last
time. For her own sake, I ought to rejoice, as she's engaged to be
married. And if you can save her from coming to grief over this
very ticklish business, she'll probably live happily ever after.
Did you know of her engagement?"</p>
<p>"No," replied Ivor. "I saw Miss de Renzie often when she was
acting in London a year ago; but after she went to Paris&mdash;of
course, she's very busy and has crowds of friends; and I've only
crossed once or twice since, on hurried visits; so we haven't met,
or written to each other."</p>
<p>("Very good reason," I thought bitterly, behind my sofa. "You've
been busy, too&mdash;falling in love with Diana Forrest.")</p>
<p>"It hasn't been announced yet, but I thought as an old friend
you might have been told. I believe Mademoiselle wants to surprise
everybody when the right time comes&mdash;if the poor girl isn't
ruined irretrievably in this affair of ours."</p>
<p>"Is there really serious danger of that?" "The most serious. If
you can't save her, not only will the <i>Entente Cordiale</i> be
shaken to its foundations (and I say nothing of my own reputation,
which is at stake), but her future happiness will be broken in the
crash, and&mdash;she says&mdash;she will not live to suffer the
agony of her loss. She will kill herself if disaster comes; and
though suicide is usually the last resource of a coward,
Mademoiselle de Renzie is no coward, and I'm inclined to think I
should come to the same resolve in her place."</p>
<p>"Tell me what I am to do," said Ivor, evidently moved by the
Foreign Secretary's strange words, and his intense earnestness.</p>
<p>"You will go to Paris by the first train to-morrow morning,
without mentioning your intention to anyone; you will drive at once
to some hotel where you have never stayed and are not known. I will
find means of informing the lady what hotel you choose. You will
there give a fictitious name (let us say, George Sandford) and you
will take a suite, with a private sitting-room. That done, you will
say that you are expecting a lady to call upon you, and will see no
one else. You will wait till Mademoiselle de Renzie appears, which
will certainly be as soon as she can possibly manage; and when you
and she are alone together, sure that you're not being spied upon,
you will put into her hands a small packet which I shall give you
before we part to-night."</p>
<p>"It sounds simple enough," said Ivor, "if that's all."</p>
<p>"It is all. Yet it may be anything but simple."</p>
<p>"Would you prefer to have me call at her house, and save her
coming to a hotel? I'd willingly do so if&mdash;"</p>
<p>"No. As I told you, should it be known that you and she meet,
those who are watching her at present ought not to suspect the real
motive of the meeting. So much the better for us: but we must think
of her. After four o'clock every afternoon, the young Frenchman
she's engaged to is in the habit of going to her house, and
stopping until it's time for her to go to work. He dines with her,
but doesn't drive with her to the theatre, as that would be rather
too public for the present, until their engagement's announced. He
adores her, but is inconveniently jealous, like most Latins. It's
practically certain that he's heard your name mentioned in
connection with hers, when she was in London, and as a Frenchman
invariably fails to understand that a man can admire a beautiful
woman without being in love with her, your call at her house might
give Mademoiselle Maxine a <i>mauvais quart d'heure</i>."</p>
<p>"I see. But if she sends him away, and comes to my
hotel&mdash;"</p>
<p>"She'll probably make some excuse about being obliged to go to
the theatre early, and thus get rid of him. She's quite clever
enough to manage that. Then, as your own name won't appear on any
hotel list in the papers next day, the most jealous heart need have
no cause for suspicion. At the same time, if certain persons whom
Mademoiselle&mdash;and we, too&mdash;have to fear, do find out that
she has visited Ivor Dundas, who has assumed a false name for the
pleasure of a private interview with her, interests of even deeper
importance than the most desperate love affair may still, we'll
hope, be guarded by the pretext of your old friendship. Now, you
understand thoroughly?"</p>
<p>"I think so," replied Ivor, very grave and troubled, I knew by
the change in his manner, out of which all the gaiety had been
slowly drained. "I will do my very best."</p>
<p>"If you are sacrificing any important engagements of your own
for the next two days, you won't suffer for it in the end,"
remarked the Foreign Secretary meaningly.</p>
<p>No doubt Ivor saw the consulship at Algiers dancing before his
eyes, bound up with an engagement to Di, just as a slice of rich
plum cake and white bride cake are tied together with bows of satin
ribbons sometimes, in America. I didn't want him to have the
consulship, because getting that would perhaps mean getting Di,
too.</p>
<p>"Thank you," said Ivor.</p>
<p>"And what hotel shall you choose in Paris?" asked the Foreign
Secretary. "It should be a good one, I don't need to remind you,
where Mademoiselle de Renzie could go without danger of
compromising herself, in case she should be recognised in spite of
the veil she's pretty certain to wear. Yet it shouldn't be in too
central a situation."</p>
<p>"Shall it be the &Eacute;lys&egrave;e Palace?" asked Ivor.</p>
<p>"That will do very well," replied the other, after reflecting
for an instant. And I could have clapped my hands, in what Ivor
would call my "impish joy," when it was settled; for the
&Eacute;lys&egrave;e Palace is where Lord and Lady Mountstuart stop
when they visit Paris, and they'd been talking of running over next
day with Lord Robert West, to look at a wonderful new motor car for
sale there&mdash;one that a Rajah had ordered to be made for him,
but died before it was finished. Lady Mountstuart always has one
new fad every six months at least, and her latest is to drive a
motor car herself. Lord Robert is a great expert&mdash;can make a
motor, I believe, or take it to pieces and put it together again;
and he'd been insisting for days that she would be able to drive
this Rajah car. She'd promised, that if not too tired she'd cross
to Paris the day after the ball, taking the afternoon train, via
Boulogne, as she wouldn't be equal to an early start. Now, I
thought, how splendid it would be if she should see Maxine at the
hotel with Ivor!</p>
<p>The Foreign Secretary was advising Ivor to wire the
&Eacute;lys&egrave;e Palace for rooms without any delay, as there
must be no hitch about his meeting Maxine, once it was arranged for
her to go there. "Any misunderstanding would be fatal," he went on,
as solemnly as if the safety of Maxine's head depended upon Ivor's
trip. "I only wish I could have got you off to-night; and in that
case you might have gone to her own house, early in the morning.
She is in a frightful state of mind, poor girl. But it was only
to-day that the contents of the packet reached me, and was shown to
the Prime Minister. Then, it was just before I hurried round here
to see you that I received a cypher telegram from her, warning me
that Count Godensky&mdash;of whom you've probably heard&mdash;an
attach&eacute; of the Russian embassy in Paris, somehow has come to
suspect a&mdash;er&mdash;a game in high politics which she and I
have been playing; her last, according to present intentions, as I
told you. I have an idea that this man, who's well known in Paris
society, proposed to Mademoiselle de Renzie, refused to take no for
an answer, and bored her until she perhaps was goaded into giving
him a severe snub. Godensky is a vain man, and wouldn't forgive a
snub, especially if it had got talked about. He'd be a bad enemy:
and Mademoiselle seems to think that he is a very bitter and
determined enemy. Apparently she doesn't know how much he has found
out, or whether he has actually found out anything at all, or
merely guesses, and 'bluffs.' But one thing is unfortunately
certain, I believe. Every boat and every train between London and
Paris will be watched more closely than usual for the next day or
two. Any known or suspected agent wouldn't get through
unchallenged. But I can see no reason why you should not."</p>
<p>"Nor I," answered Ivor, laughing a little. "I think I could make
some trouble for anyone who tried to stop me."</p>
<p>"Caution above all! Remember you're in training for a diplomatic
career, what? If you should lose the packet I'm going to give you,
I prophesy that in twenty-four hours the world would be empty of
Maxine de Renzie: for the circumstances surrounding her in this
transaction are peculiar, the most peculiar I've ever been
entangled in, perhaps, in rather a varied experience; and they
intimately concern her fianc&eacute;, the Vicomte Raoul du
Laurier&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Raoul du Laurier!" exclaimed Ivor. "So she's engaged to marry
him!"</p>
<p>"Yes. Do you know him?"</p>
<p>"I have friends who do. He's in the French Foreign Office,
though they say he's more at home in the hunting field, or writing
plays&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Which don't get produced. Quite so. But they will get produced
some day, for I believe he's an extremely clever fellow in his
way&mdash;in everything except the diplomatic 'trade' which his
father would have him take up, and got him into, through Heaven
knows what influence. No; Du Laurier's no fool, and is said to be a
fine sportsman, as well as almost absurdly good-looking.
Mademoiselle Maxine has plenty of excuse for her
infatuation&mdash;for I assure you it's nothing less. She'd jump
into the fire for this young man, and grill with a Joan of Arc
smile on her face."</p>
<p>This would have been pleasant hearing for Ivor, if he'd ever
been really in love with Maxine; but I was obliged to admit to
myself that he hadn't, for he didn't seem to care in the least. On
the contrary, he grew a little more cheerful.</p>
<p>"I can see that du Laurier's being in the French Foreign Office
might make it rather awkward for Miss de Renzie if she&mdash;if
she's been rather too helpful to us," he said.</p>
<p>"Exactly. And thereby hangs a tale&mdash;a sensational and even
romantic tale almost complicated enough for the plot of a novel.
When you meet Mademoiselle to-morrow afternoon or evening, if she
cares to take you into her confidence, in reward for your services,
in regard to some private interests of her own which have got
themselves wildly mixed up with the gravest political matters,
she's at liberty to do so as far as I'm concerned, for you are to
be trusted, and deserve to be trusted. You may say that to her from
me, if the occasion arises. I hope with all my heart that
everything may go smoothly. If not&mdash;the <i>Entente
Cordiale</i> may burst like a bomb. I&mdash;who have made myself
responsible in the matter, with the clear understanding that
England will deny me if the scheme's a failure&mdash;shall be
shattered by a flying fragment. The favourite actress of Paris will
be asphyxiated by the poisonous fumes; and you, though I hope no
worse harm may come to you, will mourn for the misfortunes of
others. Your responsibility will be such that it will be almost as
if you carried the destructive bomb itself, until you get the
packet into the hands of Maxine de Renzie." "Good heavens, I shall
be glad when she has it!" said Ivor.</p>
<p>"You can't be gladder than she&mdash;or I. And here it is,"
replied the Foreign Secretary. "I consider it great luck to have
found such a messenger, at a house I could enter without being
suspected of any motive more subtle than a wish to eat a good
supper, or to meet some of the prettiest women in London."</p>
<p>I would have given a great deal to see what he was giving Ivor
to take to Maxine, and I was half tempted to lift myself up and
peep at the two from behind the lounge, but I could tell from their
voices that they were standing quite near, and it would have been
too dangerous. The Foreign Secretary, who is rather a nervous man,
and fastidious about a woman's looks, never could bear me: and I
believe he would have thought it almost as justifiable as drowning
an ugly kitten, to choke me if he knew I'd overheard his
secrets.</p>
<p>However, Ivor's next words gave me some inkling of what I wished
to know. "It's importance evidently doesn't consist in bulk," he
said lightly. "I can easily carry the case in my breast
pocket."</p>
<p>"Pray put it there at once, and guard it as you would guard the
life and honour of a woman," said the Foreign Secretary solemnly.
"Now, I, must go and look for my wife. It's better that you and I
shouldn't be seen together. One never knows who may have got in
among the guests at a crush like this. I will go out at one door,
and when you've waited for a few minutes, you can go, by way of
another."</p>
<p>A moment later there was silence in the room, and I knew that
Ivor was alone. What if I spoke, and startled him? All that is
impish in me longed to see how his face would look; but there was
too much at stake. Not only would I hate to have him scorn me for
an eavesdropper, but I had already built up a great plan for the
use I could make of what I had overheard.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>LISA MAKES MISCHIEF</h3>
<p>When Ivor was safely out of the room, my first thought was to
escape from behind the lounge, and get upstairs to my own quarters.
But just as I had sat up, very cramped and wretched, with one foot
and one arm asleep, Lord Mountstuart came in again, and down I had
to duck.</p>
<p>He had brought a friend, who was as mad about old books and
first editions, as he; a stuffy, elderly thing, who had never seen
Lord Mountstuart's treasures before. As both were perfectly daft on
the subject, they must have kept me lying there an hour, while they
fussed about from one glass-protected book-case to another,
murmuring admiration of Caxtons, or discussing the value of a
Mazarin Bible, with their noses in a lot of old volumes which ought
to have been eaten up by moths long ago. As for me, I should have
been delighted to set fire to the whole lot.</p>
<p>At last Lord Mountstuart (whom I've nicknamed "Stewey")
remembered that there was a ball going on, and that he was the
host. So he and the other duffer pottered away, leaving the coast
clear and the door wide open. It was just my luck (which is always
bad and always has been) that a pair of flirting idiots, for whom
the conservatory, or our "den," or the stairs, wasn't secluded
enough, must needs be prying about and spy that open door before I
had conquered my cramps and got up from behind the sofa.</p>
<p>The dim light commended itself to their silliness, and after
hesitating a minute, the girl&mdash;whoever she was&mdash;allowed
herself to be drawn into a room where she had no business to be.
Then, to make bad worse, they selected the lounge to sit upon, and
I had to lie closely wedged against the wall, with "pins and
needles" pricking all over my cramped body, while some man I didn't
know proposed and was accepted by some girl I shall probably never
see.</p>
<p>They continued to sit, making a tremendous fuss about each
other, until voices were "heard off," as they say in the directions
for theatricals, whereupon they sprang up and hurried out like
"guilty things upon a fearful summons."</p>
<p>By that time I was more dead than alive, but I did manage to
crawl out of my prison, and creep up to my room by a back stairway
which the servants use. But it was very late now, and people were
going, even the young ones who love dancing. As soon as I was able,
I scuttled out of my ball dress and into a dressing gown. Also I
undid my hair, which is my one beauty, and let it hang over my
shoulders, streaming down in front on each side, so that nobody
would know one shoulder is higher than the other. It wasn't that I
was particularly anxious to appear well before Di (though I have
enough vanity not to like the contrast between us to seem too
great, even when she and I are alone), but because I wanted her to
think, when she came to my room, that I'd been there a long
time.</p>
<p>I was sure she would come and peep in at the door, to steal away
if she found me asleep, or to enquire how I felt if I were
awake.</p>
<p>By and by the handle of the door moved softly, just as I had
expected, and seeing a light, Di came in. It was late, and she had
danced all night, but instead of looking tired she was radiant.
When she spoke, her voice was as gay and happy as Ivor's had been
when he first came into Lord Mountstuart's study with the Foreign
Secretary.</p>
<p>I said that I was much better, and had had a nice rest; that if
I hadn't wanted to hear how everything had gone at the ball, I
should have been in bed and asleep long ago.</p>
<p>"Everything went very well," said she. "I think it was a great
success."</p>
<p>"Did you dance every dance?" I asked, working up slowly to what
I meant to say.</p>
<p>"Except a few that I sat out."</p>
<p>"I can guess who sat them out with you," said I. "Ivor Dundas.
And one was number thirteen, wasn't it?"</p>
<p>"How did you know?"</p>
<p>"He told me he was going to have thirteen with you. Oh, you
needn't try to hide anything from me. He tells most things to his
'Imp.' Was he nice when he proposed?"</p>
<p>"He didn't propose."</p>
<p>"I'll give you the sapphire bracelet Lady Mountstuart gave me,
if he didn't tell you he loved you, and ask if there'd be a chance
for him in case he got Algiers."</p>
<p>"I wouldn't take your bracelet even if&mdash;if&mdash;. But
you're a little witch, Lisa."</p>
<p>"Of course I am!" I exclaimed, smiling, though I had a sickening
wrench of the heart. "And I suppose you forgot all his faults and
failings, and said he could have you, Algiers or no Algiers."</p>
<p>"I don't believe he has all those faults and failings you were
talking about this evening," said Di, with her cheeks very pink.
"He may have flirted a little at one time. Women have spoiled him a
lot. But&mdash;but he <i>does</i> love me, Lisa."</p>
<p>"And he did love Maxine!" I laughed.</p>
<p>"He didn't. He never loved her. I&mdash;you see, you put such
horrid thoughts into my head that&mdash;that I just mentioned her
name when he said to-night&mdash;oh, when he said the usual things,
about never having cared seriously for anyone until he saw me.
Only&mdash;it seems treacherous to call them '<i>usual</i>'
because&mdash;when you love a man you feel that the things he says
can never have been said before, in the same way, by any other man
to any other woman."</p>
<p>"Only perhaps by the same man to another woman," I mocked at
her, trying to act as if I were teasing in fun.</p>
<p>"Lisa, you <i>can</i> be hateful sometimes!" she cried.</p>
<p>"It's only for your good, if I'm hateful now," I said. "I don't
want to have you disappointed, when it's too late. I want you to
keep your eyes open, and see exactly where you're going. It's the
truest thing ever said that 'love is blind.' You can't deny that
you're in love with Ivor Dundas."</p>
<p>"I don't deny it," she answered, with a proud air which would, I
suppose, have made Ivor want to kiss her.</p>
<p>"And you didn't deny it to him?"</p>
<p>"No, I didn't. But thanks to you, I put him upon a kind of
probation. I wish I hadn't, now. I wish I'd shown that I trusted
him entirely. I know he deserves to be trusted; and to-morrow I
shall tell him&mdash;"</p>
<p>"I don't think I should commit myself any further till day after
to-morrow," said I drily. "Indeed, you couldn't if you wanted to,
unless you wrote or wired. You won't see him to-morrow."</p>
<p>"Yes, I shall," she contradicted me, opening those big hazel
eyes of hers, that looked positively black with excitement. "He's
going to the Duchess of Glasgow's bazaar, because I said I should
most likely be there: and I will go&mdash;"</p>
<p>"But he won't."</p>
<p>"How can you know anything about it?"</p>
<p>"I do know, everything. And I'll tell you what I know, if you'll
promise me two things."</p>
<p>"What things?"</p>
<p>"That you won't ask me how I found out, and that you'll swear
never to give me away to anybody."</p>
<p>"Of course I wouldn't 'give you away,' as you call it.
But&mdash;I'm not sure I want you to tell me. I have faith in Ivor.
I'd rather not hear stories behind his back."</p>
<p>"Oh, very well, then, go to the Duchess's to-morrow," I snapped,
"and wear your prettiest frock to please Ivor, when just about that
time he'll be arriving in Paris to keep a very particular
engagement with Maxine de Renzie."</p>
<p>Di grew suddenly pale, and her eyes looked violet instead of
black. "I don't believe he's going to Paris!" she exclaimed.</p>
<p>"I know he's going. And I know he's going especially to see
Maxine."</p>
<p>"It can't be. He told me to-night he wouldn't cross the street
to see her. I&mdash;I made it a condition&mdash;that if he found he
cared enough for her to want to see her again, he must go, of
course: but he must give up all thought of me. If I'm to reign, I
must reign alone."</p>
<p>"Well, then, on thinking it over, he probably did find that he
wanted to see her."</p>
<p>"No. For he loved me just as much when we parted, only half an
hour ago."</p>
<p>"Yet at least two hours ago he'd arranged a meeting with Maxine
for to-morrow afternoon."</p>
<p>"You're dreaming."</p>
<p>"I was never wider awake: or if I'm dreaming, you can dream the
same dream if you'll be at Victoria Station to-morrow, or rather
this morning, when the boat train goes out at 10 o'clock."</p>
<p>"I will be there!" cried Di, changing from red to white. "And
you shall be with me, to see that you're wrong. I know you will be
wrong."</p>
<p>"That's an engagement," said I. "At 10 o'clock, Victoria
Station, just you and I, and nobody else in the house the wiser. If
I'm right, and Ivor's there, shall you think it wise to give him
up?"</p>
<p>"He might be obliged to go to Paris, suddenly, for some business
reason, without meaning to call on Maxine de Renzie&mdash;in which
case he'd probably write me. But&mdash;at the station, I shall ask
him straight out&mdash;that is, if he's there, as I'm sure he won't
be&mdash;whether he intends to see Mademoiselle de Renzie. If he
says no, I'll believe him. If he says yes&mdash;"</p>
<p>"You'll tell him all is over between you?"</p>
<p>"He'd know that without my telling, after our talk last
night."</p>
<p>"And whatever happens, you will say nothing about having heard
Maxine's name from me?"</p>
<p>"Nothing," Di answered. And I knew she would keep her word.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>IVOR TRAVELS TO PARIS</h3>
<p>It is rather a startling sensation for a man to be caught
suddenly by the nape of the neck, so to speak, and pitched out of
heaven down to&mdash;the other place.</p>
<p>But that was what happened to me when I arrived at Victoria
Station, on my way to Paris.</p>
<p>I had taken my ticket and hurried on to the platform without too
much time to spare (I'd been warned not to risk observation by
being too early) when I came face to face with the girl whom, at
any other time, I should have liked best to meet: whom at that
particular time I least wished to meet: Diana Forrest.</p>
<p>"The Imp"&mdash;Lisa Drummond&mdash;was with her: but I saw only
Di at first&mdash; Di, looking a little pale and harassed, but
beautiful as always. Only last night I had told her that Paris had
no attractions for me. I had said that I didn't care to see Maxine
de Renzie: yet here I was on the way to see her, and here was Di
discovering me in the act of going to see, her.</p>
<p>Of course I could lie; and I suppose some men, even men of
honour, would think it justifiable as well as wise to lie in such a
case, when explanations were forbidden. But I couldn't lie to a
girl I loved as I love Diana Forrest. It would have sickened me
with life and with myself to do it: and it was with the knowledge
in my mind that I could not and would not lie, that I had to greet
her with a conventional "Good morning."</p>
<p>"Are you going out of town?" I asked, with my hat off for her
and for the Imp, whose strange little weazened face I now saw
looking over my tall love's shoulders. It had never before struck
me that the Imp was like a cat; but suddenly the resemblance struck
me&mdash;something in the poor little creature's expression, it
must have been, or in her greenish grey eyes which seemed at that
moment to concentrate all the knowledge of old and evil things that
has ever come into the world since the days of the early
Egyptians&mdash;when a cat was worshipped.</p>
<p>"No, I'm not going out of town," Di answered. "I came here to
meet you, in case you should be leaving by this train, and I
brought Lisa with me."</p>
<p>"Who told you I was leaving?" I asked, hoping for a second or
two that the Foreign Secretary had confided to her something of his
secret&mdash;guessing ours, perhaps, and that my unexpected,
inexplicable absence might injure me with her.</p>
<p>"I can't tell you," she answered. "I didn't believe you would
go; even though I got your letter by the eight o'clock post this
morning."</p>
<p>"I'm glad you got that," I said. "I posted it soon after I left
you last night."</p>
<p>"Why didn't you tell me when we were bidding each other
good-bye, that you wouldn't be able to see me this afternoon,
instead of waiting to write?"</p>
<p>"Frankly and honestly," I said (for I had to say it), "just at
the moment, and only for the moment, I forgot about the Duchess of
Glasgow's bazaar. That was because, after I decided to drop in at
the bazaar, something happened which made it impossible for me to
go. In my letter I begged you to let me see you to-morrow instead;
and now I beg it again. Do say 'yes.'"</p>
<p>"I'll say yes on one condition&mdash;and gladly," she replied,
with an odd, pale little smile, "that you tell me where you're
going this morning. I know it must seem horrid in me to ask,
but&mdash;but&mdash;oh, Ivor, it <i>isn't</i> horrid, really. You
wouldn't think it horrid if you could understand."</p>
<p>"I'm going to Paris," I answered, beginning to feel as if I had
a cold potato where my heart ought to be. "I am obliged to go, on
business."</p>
<p>"You didn't say anything about Paris in your letter this
morning, when you told me you couldn't come to the Duchess's," said
Di, looking like a beautiful, unhappy child, her eyes big and
appealing, her mouth proud. "You only mentioned 'an urgent
engagement which you'd forgotten.'"</p>
<p>"I thought that would be enough to explain, in a hurry," I told
her, lamely.</p>
<p>"So it was&mdash;so it would have been," she faltered, "if it
hadn't been for&mdash;what we said last night about&mdash;Paris.
And then&mdash;I can't explain to you, Ivor, any more than it seems
you can to me. But I did hear you meant to go there,
and&mdash;after our talk, I couldn't believe it. I didn't come to
the station to find you; I came because I was perfectly sure I
wouldn't find you, and wanted to prove that I hadn't found you.
Yet&mdash;you're here."</p>
<p>"And, though I am here, you will trust me just the same," I
said, as firmly as I could.</p>
<p>"Of course. I'll trust you, if&mdash;"</p>
<p>"If what?"</p>
<p>"If you'll tell me just one little, tiny thing: that you're not
going to see Maxine de Renzie."</p>
<p>"I may see her," I admitted.</p>
<p>"But&mdash;but at least, you're not going on purpose?"</p>
<p>This drove me into a corner. Without being disloyal to the
Foreign Secretary, I could not deny all personal desire to meet
Maxine. Yet to what suspicion was I not laying myself open in
confessing that I deliberately intended to see her, having sworn by
all things a man does swear by when he wishes to please a girl,
that I didn't wish to see Maxine, and would not see Maxine?</p>
<p>"You said you'd trust me, Di," I reminded her. "For Heaven's
sake don't break that promise."</p>
<p>"But&mdash;if you're breaking a promise to me?"</p>
<p>"A promise?"</p>
<p>"Worse, then! Because I didn't ask you to promise. I had too
much faith in you for that. I believed you when you said you didn't
care for&mdash;anyone but me. I've told Lisa. It doesn't matter our
speaking like this before her. I asked you to wait for my promise
for a little while, until I could be quite sure you didn't think of
Miss de Renzie as&mdash;some people fancied you did. If you wanted
to see her, I said you must go, and you laughed at the idea. Yet
the very next morning, by the first train, you start."</p>
<p>"Only because I am obliged to," I hazarded in spite of the
Foreign Secretary and his precautions. But I was punished for my
lack of them by making matters worse instead of better for
myself.</p>
<p>"Obliged to!" she echoed. "Then there's something you must
settle with her, before you can be&mdash;free."</p>
<p>The guard was shutting the carriage doors. In another minute I
should lose the train. And I must not lose the train. For her
future and mine, as well as Maxine's, I must not.</p>
<p>"Dearest," I said hurriedly, "I am free. There's no question of
freedom. Yet I shall have to go. I hold you to your word. Trust
me."</p>
<p>"Not if you go to her&mdash;this day of all days." The words
were wrung from the poor child's lips, I could see, by sheer
anguish, and it was like death to me that I should have to cause
her this anguish, instead of soothing it.</p>
<p>"You shall. You must," I commanded, rather than implored.
"Good-bye, darling&mdash;precious one. I shall think of you every
instant, and I shall come back to you to-morrow."</p>
<p>"You needn't. You need never come to me again," she said, white
lipped. And the guard whistled, waving his green flag.</p>
<p>"Don't dare to say such a cruel thing&mdash;a thing you don't
mean!" I cried, catching at the closed door of a first-class
compartment. As I did so, a little man inside jumped to the window
and shouted, "Reserved! Don't you see it's reserved?" which
explained the fact that the door seemed to be fastened.</p>
<p>I stepped back, my eyes falling on the label to which the man
pointed, and would have tried the handle of the next carriage, had
not two men rushed at the door as the train began to move, and
dexterously opened it with a railway key. Their throwing themselves
thus in my way would have lost me my last chance of catching the
moving train, had I not dashed in after them. If I could choose, I
would be the last man to obtrude myself where I was not wanted, but
there was no time to choose; and I was thankful to get in anywhere,
rather than break my word. Besides, my heart was too sore at
leaving Diana as I had had to leave her, to care much for anything
else. I had just sense enough to fight my way in, though the two
men with the key (not the one who had occupied the compartment
first), now yelled that it was reserved, and would have pushed me
out if I hadn't been too strong for them. I had a dim impression
that, instead of joining with the newcomers, the first man, who
would have kept the place to himself before their entrance, seemed
willing to aid me against the others. They being once foisted upon
him, he appeared to wish for my presence too, or else he merely
desired to prevent me from being dashed onto the platform and
perhaps killed, for he thrust out a hand and tried to pull me
in.</p>
<p>At the same time a guard came along, protesting against the
unseemly struggle, and the carriage door was slammed shut upon us
all four.</p>
<p>When I got my balance, and was able to look out, the train had
gone so far that Diana and Lisa had been swept away from my sight.
It was like a bad omen; and the fear was cold upon me that I had
lost my love for ever.</p>
<p>At that moment I suffered so atrociously that if it had not been
too late, I fear I should have sacrificed Maxine and the Foreign
Secretary and even the <i>Entente Cordiale</i> (provided he had not
been exaggerating) for Di's sake, and love's sake. But there was no
going back now, even if I would. The train was already travelling
almost at full speed, and there was nothing to do but resign myself
to the inevitable, and hope for the best. Someone, it was clear,
had tried to work mischief between Diana and me, and there were
only too many chances that he had succeeded. Could it be Bob West,
I asked myself, as I half-dazedly looked for a place to sit down
among the litter of small luggage with which the first occupant of
the carriage had strewn every seat. I knew that Bob was as much in
love with Di as a man of his rather unintellectual, unimaginative
type could be, and he hadn't shown himself as friendly lately to me
as he once had: still, I didn't think he was the sort of fellow to
trip up a rival in the race by a trick, even if he could possibly
have found out that I was going to Paris this morning.</p>
<p>"Won't you sit here, sir?" a voice broke into my thoughts, and I
saw that the little man had cleared a place for me next his own,
which was in a corner facing the engine. Thanking him
absent-mindedly, I sat down, and began to observe my travelling
companions for the first time.</p>
<p>So far, their faces had been mere blurs for me: but now it
struck me that all three were rather peculiar; that is, peculiar
when seen in a first-class carriage.</p>
<p>The man who had reserved the compartment for himself, and who
had removed a bundle of golf sticks from the seat to make room for
me, did not look like a typical golfer, nor did he appear at all
the sort of person who might be expected to reserve a whole
compartment for himself. He was small and thin, and weedy, with
little blinking, pink-rimmed eyes of the kind which ought to have
had white lashes instead of the sparse, jet black ones that rimmed
them. His forehead, though narrow, suggested shrewdness, as did the
expression of those light coloured eyes of his, which were set
close to the sharp, slightly up-turned nose. His hair was so black
that it made his skin seem singularly pallid, though it was only
sallow; and a mean, rabbit mouth worked nervously over two
prominent teeth. Though his clothes were good, and new, they had
the air of having been bought ready made; and in spite of his
would-be "smart" get up, the man (who might have been anywhere
between thirty and thirty-eight) looked somewhat like an ex-groom,
or bookmaker, masquerading as a "swell."</p>
<p>The two intruders who had violated the sanctity of the reserved
compartment by means of their railway key were both bigger and more
manly than he who had a right to it. One was dark, and probably
Jewish, with a heavy beard and moustache, in the midst of which his
sensual and cruel mouth pouted disagreeably red. The other was
puffy and flushed, with a brick-coloured complexion deeply pitted
by smallpox. They also were flashily dressed with "horsey" neckties
and conspicuous scarf-pins. As I glanced at the pair, they were
talking together in a low voice, with an open newspaper held up
between them; but the man who had helped me in against their will
sat silent, staring out of the window and uneasily fingering his
collar. Not one of the trio was, apparently, paying the slightest
attention to me, now that I was seated; nevertheless I thought of
the large, long letter-case which I carried in an inner breast
pocket of my carefully buttoned coat. I would not attract attention
to the contents of that pocket by touching it, to assure myself
that it was safe, but I had done so just before meeting Di, and I
felt certain that nothing could have happened to it since.</p>
<p>I folded my arms across my chest, glanced up to see where the
cord of communication might be found in case of emergency; and then
reflected that these men were not likely to be dangerous, since I
had followed them into the compartment, not they me. This thought
was reassuring, as they were three to one if they combined against
me, and the train was, unfortunately, not entirely a corridor
train. Therefore, having assured myself that I was not among spies
bent on having my life or the secret I carried, I forgot about my
fellow-travellers, and fell into gloomy speculations as to my
chances with Diana. I had been loving her, thinking of little else
but her and my hopes of her, for many months now; but never had I
realised what a miserable, empty world it would be for me without
Di for my own, as I did now, when I had perhaps lost her.</p>
<p>Not that I would allow myself to think that I could not get her
back. I would not think it. I would force her to believe in me, to
trust me, even to repent her suspicions, though appearances were
all against me, and Heaven knew how much or when I might be
permitted to explain. I would not be a man if I took her at her
word, and let her slip from me, no matter how many times that word
were repeated; so I told myself over and over. Yet a voice inside
me seemed to say that nothing could be as it had been; that I'd
sacrificed my happiness to please a stranger, and to save a woman
whom I had never really loved.</p>
<p>Di was so beautiful, so sweet, so used to being admired by men;
there were so many who loved her, so many with a thousand times
more to offer than I had or would ever have: how could I hope that
she would go on caring for me, after what had happened to-day? I
wondered. She hadn't said in actual words last night that she would
marry me, whereas this morning she had almost said she never would.
I should have nobody to blame but myself if I came back to London
to-morrow to find her engaged to Lord Robert West&mdash;a man who,
as his brother has no children, might some day make her a
Duchess.</p>
<p>"Sorry to have seemed rude just now, sir," said one of the two
railway-key men, suddenly reminding me of his unnecessary
existence. "Hardly knew what I was about when I shoved you away
from the door. Me and my friend was afraid of missing the train, so
we pushed&mdash;instinct of self-preservation, I suppose," and he
chuckled as if he had got off some witticism. "Anyhow, I apologise.
Nothing intentional, 'pon my word."</p>
<p>"Thanks. No apology is necessary," I replied as indifferently as
I felt.</p>
<p>"That's all right, then," finished the Jewish-faced man, who had
spoken. He turned to his companion, and the two resumed their
conversation behind the newspaper: but I now became conscious that
they occasionally glanced over the top at their neighbour or at me,
as if their whole attention were not taken up with the news of the
day.</p>
<p>Any interest they might feel in me, provided it had nothing to
do with a certain pocket, they were welcome to: but the little man
was apparently not of the same mind concerning himself. His
nervously twitching hand on the upholstered seat-arm which
separated his place from mine attracted my attention, which was
then drawn up to his face. He was so sickly pale, under a kind of
yellowish glaze spread over his complexion, that I thought he must
be ill, perhaps suffering from train sickness, in anxious
anticipation of the horrors which might be in store for him on the
boat. Presently he pulled out a red-bordered handkerchief, and
unobtrusively wiped his forehead, under his checked travelling cap.
When he had done this, I saw that his hair was left streaked with
damp; and there was a faint, purplish stain on the handkerchief,
observing which with evident dismay he stuffed the big square of
coarse cambric hastily into his pocket.</p>
<p>"The little beast must dye his hair," I thought contemptuously.
"Perhaps he's an albino, really. His eyes look like it."</p>
<p>With that, he threw a frightened glance at me, which caused me
to turn away and spare him the humiliation of knowing that he was
observed. But immediately after, he made an effort to pull himself
together, picking up a book he had laid down to wipe his forehead
and holding it so close to his nose that the printed page must have
been a mere blur, unless he were very near-sighted. Thus he sat for
some time; yet I felt that no look thrown by the other two was lost
on him. He seemed to know each time one of them peered over the
newspaper; and when at last the train slowed down by the Admiralty
Pier all his nervousness returned. His small, thin hands, freckled
on their backs, hovered over one piece of luggage after another, as
if he could not decide how to pile the things together.</p>
<p>Naturally I had not brought my man with me on this errand,
therefore I had let my suitcase go into the van, that I might have
both hands free, and I had nothing to do when the train stopped but
jump out and make for the boat. Nevertheless I lingered, folding up
a newspaper, and tearing an article out of a magazine by way of
excuse; for it was not my object to be caught in a crowd and
hustled, perhaps, by some clever wretches who might be lying in
wait for what I had in my pocket. It seemed impossible that anyone
could have learned that I was playing messenger between the British
Secretary for Foreign Affairs and Maxine de Renzie: still, the
danger and difficulty of the apparently simple mission had been so
strongly impressed on me that I did not intend to neglect any
precaution.</p>
<p>I lingered therefore; and the Jewish-looking man with his
heavy-faced friend lingered also, for some reason of their own.
They had no luggage, except a small handbag each, but these they
opened at the last minute to stuff in their newspapers, and
apparently to review the other contents. Presently, when the first
rush for the boat was over, and the porters who had come to the
door of our compartment had gone away empty-handed, I would have
got out, had I not caught an imploring glance from the little man
who had reserved the carriage. Perhaps I imagined it, but his
pink-rimmed eyes seemed to say, "For heaven's sake, don't leave me
alone with these others."</p>
<p>"Would you be so very kind, sir," he said to me, "to beckon a
porter, as you are near the door? I find after all that I shan't be
able to carry everything myself."</p>
<p>I did as he asked; and there was so much confusion in the
carriage when the porter came, that in self-defence the two friends
got out with their bags. I also descended and would have followed
in the wake of the crowd, if the little man had not called after
me. He had lost his ticket, he said. Would I be so extremely
obliging as to throw an eye about the platform to see if it had
fallen there?</p>
<p>I did oblige him in this manner, without avail; but by this time
he had found the missing treasure in the folds of his travelling
rug; and scrambling out of the carriage, attended by the porter I
had secured for him, he would have walked by my side towards the
boat, had I not dropped behind a few steps, thinking&mdash;as
always&mdash;of the contents of that inner breast pocket.</p>
<p>He and I were now at the tail-end of the procession hastening
boatward, or almost at the tail, for there were but four or five
other passengers&mdash;a family party with a fat nurse and crying
baby&mdash;behind us. As I approached the gangway, I saw on deck my
late travelling companions, the Jewish man and his friend,
regarding us with interest. Then, just as I was about to step on
board, almost on the little man's heels, there came a cry
apparently from someone ahead: "Look out&mdash;gangway's
falling!"</p>
<p>In an instant all was confusion. The fat nurse behind me
screamed, as the nervous fellow in front leaped like a cat, intent
on saving himself no matter what happened to anyone else, and flung
me against the woman with the baby. Two or three excitable
Frenchmen just ahead also attempted to turn, thus nearly throwing
the little man onto his knees. The large bag which he carried hit
me across the shins; in his terror he almost embraced me as he
helped himself up: the nurse, as she stumbled, pitched forward onto
my shoulder, and if I had not seized the howling baby, it would
certainly have fallen under our feet.</p>
<p>My bowler was knocked over my eyes, and though an officer of the
boat cried the reassuring intelligence that it was a false
alarm&mdash;that the gangway was "all right," and never had been
anything but all right, I could not readjust my hat nor see what
was going on until the fat nurse had obligingly retrieved her
charge, without a word of thanks.</p>
<p>My first thought was for the letter-case in my pocket, for I had
a horrible idea that the scare might have been got up for the
express purpose of robbing me of it. But I could feel its outline
as plainly as ever under my coat, and decided, thankfully, that
after all the alarm had had nothing to do with me.</p>
<p>I had wired for a private cabin, thinking it would be well to be
out of the way of my fellow-passengers during the crossing: but the
weather had been rough for a day or two (it was not yet the middle
of April) and everything was already engaged; therefore I walked
the deck most of the time, always conscious of the unusual
thickness of my breast pocket. The little man paced up and down,
too, though his yellow face grew slowly green, and he would have
been much better off below, lying on his back. As for the two
others, they also remained on deck, talking together as they leaned
against the rail; but though I passed them now and again, I noticed
that the little man invariably avoided them by turning before he
reached their "pitch."</p>
<p>At the Gare du Nord I regretted that I had not carried my own
bag, because if I had it would have been examined on the boat, and
all bother would have been over. But rather than run any risks in
the crowd thronging the <i>douane</i>, I decided to let the
suitcase look after itself, and send down for it with the key from
the hotel later. Again the little man was close to my side as I
went in search of a cab, for all his things had been gone through
by the custom house officer in mid-channel, so that he too was free
to depart without delay. He even seemed to cling to me, somewhat
wistfully, and I half thought he meant to speak, but he did not,
save for a "good evening, sir," as I separated myself from him at
last. He had stuck rather too close, elbow to elbow; but I had no
fear for the letter-case, as he was on the wrong side to play any
conjurer's tricks with that. The last I saw of the fellow, he was
walking toward a cab, and looking uneasily over his shoulder at his
two late travelling companions, who were getting into another
vehicle near by.</p>
<p>I went straight to the &Eacute;lys&eacute;e Palace Hotel, where
I had never stopped before&mdash;a long drive from the Gare du
Nord&mdash;and claimed the rooms for which "Mr. George Sandford"
had wired from London. The suite engaged was a charming one, and
the private salon almost worthy to receive the lovely lady I
expected. Nor did she keep me waiting. I had had time only to give
instructions about sending a man with a key to the station for my
luggage, to say that a lady would call, to reach my rooms, and to
draw the curtains over the windows, when a knock came at the salon
door. I was in the act of turning on the electric light when this
happened, but to my surprise the room remained in darkness&mdash;or
rather, in a pink dusk lent by the colour of the curtains.</p>
<p>"The lady has arrived, Monsieur," announced the servant. "As
Monsieur expected her, she has come up without waiting; but I
regret that something has gone wrong with the electricity, all over
the hotel. It was but just now discovered, at time for turning on
the lights, otherwise lamps and plenty of candles would have been
provided, though no doubt the light will fonctionne properly in a
few minutes. If Monsieur permits, I will instantly bring him a
lamp."</p>
<p>"No, thank you," I said hurriedly, for I did not wish to be
interrupted in the midst of my important interview with Maxine. "If
the light comes on, it will he all right: if not, I will put back
the curtains; and it is not yet quite dark. Show the lady in."</p>
<p>Into the pink twilight of the curtained room came Maxine de
Renzie, whose tall and noble figure I recognised in its plain,
close-fitting black dress, though her wide brimmed hat was draped
with a thickly embroidered veil that completely hid her face, while
long, graceful lace folds fell over and obscured the bright auburn
of her hair.</p>
<p>"One moment," I said. "Let me push the curtains back. The
electricity has failed."</p>
<p>"No, no," she answered. "Better leave them as they are. The
lights may come on and we be seen from outside. Why,"&mdash;as she
drew nearer to me, and the servant closed the door, "I thought I
recognised that voice! It is Ivor Dundas."</p>
<p>"No other," said I. "Didn't the&mdash;weren't you warned who
would be the man to come?"</p>
<p>"No," she replied. "Only the assumed name of the messenger and
place of meeting were wired. It was safer so, even though the
telegram was in a cypher which I trust nobody knows&mdash;except
myself and one other. But I'm glad&mdash;glad it's you. It was
clever of&mdash;him, to have sent you. No one would dream
that&mdash;no one would think it strange if they knew&mdash;as I
hope they won't&mdash;that you came to Paris to see me. Oh, the
relief that you've got through safely! Nothing has happened? You
have&mdash;the paper?"</p>
<p>"Nothing has happened, and I have the paper," I reassured her.
"No adventures, to speak of, on the way, and no reason to think
I've been spotted. Anyway, here I am; and here is something which
will put an end to your anxiety." And I tapped the breast of my
coat, meaningly.</p>
<p>"Thank God!" breathed Maxine, with a thrilling note in her voice
which would have done her great credit on the stage, though I am
sure she was never further in her life from the thought of acting.
"After all I've suffered, it seems too good to be true. Give it to
me, quick, Ivor, and let me go."</p>
<p>"I will," I said. "But you might seem to take just a little more
interest in me, even if you don't really feel it, you know. You
might just say, 'How have you been for the last twelve
months?'"</p>
<p>"Oh, I do take an interest, and I'm grateful to you&mdash;I
can't tell you how grateful. But I have no time to think either of
you or myself now," she said, eagerly. "If you knew everything,
you'd understand."</p>
<p>"I know practically nothing," I confessed; "still, I do
understand. I was only teasing you. Forgive me. I oughtn't to have
done it, even for a minute. Here is the letter-case which the
Foreign&mdash;which was given to me to bring to you."</p>
<p>"Wait!" she exclaimed, still in the half whisper from which she
had never departed. "Wait! It will he better to lock the door." But
even as she spoke, there came a knock, loud and insistent. With a
spring, she flung herself on me, her hand fumbling for the pocket I
had tapped suggestively a moment ago. I let her draw out the long
case which I had been guarding&mdash;the case I had not once
touched since leaving London, except to feel anxiously for its
outline through my buttoned coat. At least, whatever might be about
to happen, she had it in her own hands now.</p>
<p>Neither of us spoke nor made a sound during the instant that she
clung to me, the faint, well-remembered perfume of her hair, her
dress, in my nostrils. But as she started away, and I knew that she
had the letter-case, the knock came again. Then, before I could be
sure whether she wished for time to hide, or whether she would have
me cry "come in," without seeming to hesitate, the door opened. For
a second or two Maxine and I, and a group of figures at the door
were mere shadows in the ever deepening pink dusk: but I could
scarcely have counted ten before the long expected light sprang up.
I had turned it on in more than one place: and a sudden, brilliant
illumination showed me a tall Commissary of Police, with two little
gendarmes looking over his shoulder.</p>
<p>I threw a glance at Maxine, who was still veiled, and was
relieved to see that she had found some means of putting the
letter-case out of sight. Having ascertained this, I sharply
enquired in French what in the devil's name the Commissary of
Police meant by walking into an Englishman's room without being
invited; and not only that, but what under heaven he wanted
anyway.</p>
<p>He was far more polite than I was.</p>
<p>"Ten thousand pardons, Monsieur," he apologised. "I knocked
twice, but hearing no answer, entered, thinking that perhaps, after
all, the salon was unoccupied. Important business must be my
excuse. I have to request that Monsieur Dundas will first place in
my hands the gift he has brought from London to Mademoiselle de
Renzie."</p>
<p>"I have brought no gift for Mademoiselle de Renzie," I
prevaricated boldly; but the man's knowledge of my name was
ominous. If the Paris police had contrived to learn it already, as
well as to find out that I was the bearer of something for Maxine,
it looked as if they knew enough to play the game in their own
way&mdash;whatever that might be.</p>
<p>"Perhaps I should say, the thing which Mademoiselle
lent&mdash;to a friend in England, and Monsieur has now kindly
returned," amended the Commissary of Police as politely, as
patiently, as ever.</p>
<p>"Really, I don't know what you are talking about," I said,
shrugging my shoulders and looking bewildered&mdash;or hoping that
I looked bewildered. All the while I was wondering, desperately, if
this meant ruin for Maxine, or if she would still find some way of
saving herself. But all I could do for her at the moment was to
keep calm, and tell as many lies as necessary. I hadn't been able
to lie to Diana; but I had no compunctions about doing it now, if
it were to help Maxine. The worst was, that I was far from sure it
would help her.</p>
<p>"I trust, Monsieur, that you do not wish to prevent the French
police from doing their duty," said the officer, his tone becoming
peremptory for the first time. "Should you attempt it, I should
unfortunately be compelled to order that Monsieur be searched."</p>
<p>"You seem to forget that you're dealing with a British subject,"
said I.</p>
<p>"Who is offending against the laws of a friendly country," he
capped my words. "You can complain afterwards, Monsieur. But
now&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Why don't you empty your pockets, Mr. Dundas," suggested
Maxine, lightly, yet contemptuously, "and show them that you've
nothing in which the police can have any interest? I suppose the
next thing they propose, will be to search me."</p>
<p>"I deeply regret to say that will be the next thing,
Mademoiselle, unless satisfaction is given to me," returned the
Commissary of Police.</p>
<p>Maxine threw back her thick veil; and if this were the first
time these men had ever seen the celebrated actress off the stage,
it seemed to me that her beauty must almost have dazzled them, thus
suddenly displayed. For Maxine is a gloriously handsome woman, and
never had she been most striking, more wonderful, than at that
moment, when her dark eyes laughed out of her white face, and her
red lips smiled as if neither they, nor the great eyes, had any
secret to hide.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="ctr">
<a href="images\072.jpg"><img src="images\072t.jpg" width="150"
alt="'Look at me,' she said, throwing back her arms."></a></p>
<h5>"Look at me," she said, throwing back her arms.</h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Look at me," she said, throwing back her arms in such a way as
to bring forward her slender body, in the tight black sheath of the
dress which was of the fashion which, I think, women call
"Princess." It fitted her as smoothly as the gloves that covered
her arms to the elbows.</p>
<p>"Do you think there is much chance for concealment in this
dress?" she asked. "I haven't a pocket, you see. No self-respecting
woman could have, in a gown like this. I don't know in the least
what sort of 'gift' my old friend is supposed to have brought me.
Is it large or small? I'll take off my gloves and let you see my
rings, if you like, Monsieur le Commisaire, for I've been taught,
as a servant of the public, to be civil to my fellow servants, even
if they should be unreasonable. No? You don't want to see my rings?
Let me oblige you by taking off my hat, then. I might have put the
thing&mdash;whatever it is&mdash; in my hair."</p>
<p>As she spoke, she drew out her hatpins, still laughing in a half
scornful, half good-natured way. She was bewitching as she stood
smiling, with her black hat and veil in her hand, the ruffled waves
of her dark red hair shadowing her forehead.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, fired by her example, I turned out the contents of my
pockets: a letter or two; a flat gold cigarette case; a match box;
my watch, and a handkerchief: also in an outer pocket of my coat, a
small bit of crumpled paper of which I had no recollection: but as
one of the gendarmes politely picked it up from the floor, where it
had fallen, and handed it to me without examining it, mechanically
I slipped it back into the pocket, and thought no more of it at the
time. There were too many other things to think of, and I was
wondering what on earth Maxine could have done with the
letter-case. She had had no more than two seconds in which to
dispose of it, hardly enough, it seemed to me, to pass it from one
hand to another, yet apparently it was well hidden.</p>
<p>"Now, are you satisfied?" she asked, "Now that we have both
shown you we have nothing to conceal; or would you like to take me
to the police station, and have some dreadful female search me more
thoroughly still? I'll go with you, if you wish. I won't even he
indiscreet enough to ask questions, since you seem inclined to do
what we've no need to do&mdash;keep your own secrets. All I
stipulate is, that if you care to take such measures you'll take
them at once, for as you may possibly be aware, this is the first
night of my new play, and I should be sorry to be late."</p>
<p>The Commissary of Police looked fixedly at Maxine for a moment,
as if he would read her soul.</p>
<p>"No, Mademoiselle," he said, "I am convinced that neither you
nor Monsieur are concealing anything about your persons. I will not
trouble you further until we have searched the room."</p>
<p>Maxine could not blanch, for already she was as white as she
will be when she lies in her coffin. But though her expression did
not change, I saw that the pupils of her eyes dilated. Actress that
she is, she could control her muscles; but she could not control
the beating of the blood in her brain. I felt that she was
conscious of this betrayal, under the gaze of the policeman, and
she laughed to distract his attention. My heart ached for her. I
thought of a meadow-lark manoeuvering to hide the place where her
nest lies. Poor, beautiful Maxine! In spite of her pride, her high
courage, the veneer of hardness which her experience of the world
had given, she was infinitely pathetic in my eyes; and though I had
never loved her, though I did love another woman, I would have
given my life gladly at this minute if I could have saved her from
the catastrophe she dreaded.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>IVOR DOES WHAT HE CAN FOR MAXINE</h3>
<p>"How long a time do you think I had been in this room,
Monsieur," she asked, "before you&mdash;rather rudely, I must
say&mdash;broke in upon my conversation with my friend?"</p>
<p>"You had been here exactly three minutes," replied the
Commissary of Police.</p>
<p>"As much as that? I should have thought less. We had to greet
each other, after having been parted for many months; and still, in
the three minutes, you believe that we had time to concoct a plot
of some sort, and to find some safe corner&mdash;all the while in
semi-darkness&mdash;for the hiding of a thing important to the
police&mdash;a bomb, perhaps? You must think us very clever."</p>
<p>"I know that you are very clever, Mademoiselle."</p>
<p>"Perhaps I ought to thank you for the compliment," she answered,
allowing anger to warm her voice at last; "but this is almost
beyond a joke. A woman comes to the rooms of a friend. Both of them
are so placed that they prefer her call not to be talked about. For
that reason, and for the woman's sake, the friend chooses to take a
name that isn't his&mdash;as he has a right to do. Yet, just
because that woman happens unfortunately to be well-known&mdash;her
face and name being public property&mdash;she is followed, she is
spied upon, humiliated, and all, no doubt, on account of some silly
mistake, or malicious false information. Ah, it is shameful,
Monsieur! I wonder the police of Paris can stoop to such stupidity,
such meanness."</p>
<p>"When we have found out that it is a mistake, the police of
Paris will apologise to you, Mademoiselle, through me," said the
Commissary; "until then, I regret if our duty makes us disagreeable
to you." Then, turning to his two gendarmes, he directed them to
search the room, beginning with all possible places in which a
paper parcel or large envelope might be hidden, within ten metres
of the spot where Mademoiselle and Monsieur had stood talking
together when the police opened the door.</p>
<p>Maxine did not protest again. With her head up, and a look as if
the three policemen were of no more importance to her than the
furniture of the room, she walked to the mantelpiece and stood
leaning her elbow upon it. Weariness, disgusted indifference, were
in her attitude; but I guessed that she felt herself actually in
need of the physical support.</p>
<p>The two gendarmes moved about in noiseless obedience, their
faces expressionless as masks. They did not glance at Maxine,
giving themselves entirely to the task at which they had been set.
But their superior officer did not once take his eyes from the pure
profile she turned scornfully towards him. I knew why he watched
her thus, and thought of a foolish, child's game I used to play
twenty years ago, at little-boy-and-girl parties: the game of
"Hide-the-Handkerchief." While one searched for the treasure, those
who knew where it was stood by, saying: "Now you are warm. Now you
are hot&mdash;boiling hot. Now you are cool again. Now you are ice
cold." It was as if we were five players at this game, and Maxine
de Renzie's white, deathly smiling face was expected to proclaim
against her will: "Now you are warm. Now you are hot. Now you are
ice cold."</p>
<p>There was a table in the middle of the room, with one or two
volumes of photographs and brightly-bound guide books of Paris upon
it, as well as my hat and gloves which I had tossed down as I came
in. The gendarmes picked up these things, examined them, laid them
aside, peered under the table; peeped behind the silk cushions on
the sofa, opened the doors and drawers of a bric-&agrave;-brac
cabinet and a small writing desk, lifted the corners of the rugs on
the bare, polished floor; and finally, bowing apologies to Maxine
for disturbing her, took out the logs from the fireplace where the
fire was ready for lighting, and pried into the vases on the
mantel. Also they shook the silk and lace window curtains, and
moved the pictures on the walls. When all this had been done in
vain, the pair confessed with shrugs of the shoulders that they
were at a loss.</p>
<p>During the search, which had been conducted in silence, I had a
curious sensation, caused by my intense sympathy with Maxine's
suffering. I felt as if my heart were the pendulum of a clock which
had been jarred until it was uncertain whether to go on or stop.
Once, when the gendarmes were peering under the sofa, or behind the
sofa cushions, a grey shadow round Maxine's eyes made her beautiful
face look like a death-mask in the white electric light, which did
not fail now, or spare her any cruelty of revelation. She was
smiling contemptuously still&mdash;always the same smile&mdash;but
her forehead appeared to have been sprinkled with diamond dust.</p>
<p>I saw that dewy sparkle, and wondered, sickeningly, if the enemy
saw it too. But I had not long to wait before being satisfied on
this point. The keen-eyed Frenchman gave no further instructions to
his baffled subordinates, but crossing the room to the sofa stood
staring at it fixedly. Then, grasping the back with his
capable-looking hand, instead of beginning at once a quest which
his gendarmes had abandoned, he searched the face of the tortured
woman.</p>
<p>Unflinching in courage, she seemed not to see him. But it was as
if she had suddenly ceased to breathe. Her bosom no longer rose and
fell. The only movement was the visible knocking of her heart. I
felt that, in another moment, if he found what she had hidden, her
heart would knock no longer, and she would die. For a second I
wildly counted the chances of overpowering all three men, stunning
them into unconsciousness, and giving Maxine time to escape with
the letter-case. But I knew the attempt would be useless. Even if I
could succeed, the noise would arouse the hotel. People would come.
Other policemen would rush in to the help of their comrades, and
matters would be worse with us than before.</p>
<p>The Frenchman, having looked at Maxine, and seen that tell-tale
beating of her bodice, deliberately laid the silk cushions on the
floor. Then, pushing his hand down between the seat and the back of
the sofa, he moved it along the crevice inch by inch.</p>
<p>I watched the hand, which looked cruel to me as that of an
executioner. I think Maxine watched it, too. Suddenly it stopped.
It had found something. The other hand sprang to its assistance.
Both worked together, groping and prying for a few seconds:
evidently the something hidden had been forced deeply and firmly
down. Then, up it came&mdash;a dark red leather case, which was
neither a letter-case nor a jewel-case, but might be used for
either. My heart almost stopped beating in the intense relief I
felt. For this was not the thing I had come from London to bring
Maxine.</p>
<p>I could hardly keep back a cry of joy. But I did keep it back,
for suspense and anxiety had left me a few grains of sense.</p>
<p>"Voila!" grunted the Commissary of Police. "I said that you were
clever, Mademoiselle. But it would have been as well for all
concerned if you had spared us this trouble."</p>
<p>"You alone are to blame for the trouble," answered Maxine. "I
never saw that thing before in my life."</p>
<p>I was astonished that there was no ring of satisfaction in her
voice. It sounded hard and defiant, but there was no triumph in it,
no joy that, so far, she was saved&mdash;as if by a miracle. Rather
was her tone that of a woman at bay, fighting to the last, but
without hope. "Nor did I ever see it before." I echoed her
words.</p>
<p>She glanced at me as if with gratitude. Yet there was no need
for gratitude. I was not lying for her sake, but speaking the plain
truth, as I thought that she must know.</p>
<p>For the first time the Commissary of Police condescended to
laugh. "I suppose you want me to believe that the last occupant of
this room tucked some valued possession down into a safe hiding
place&mdash;and then forgot all about it. That is likely, is it
not? You shall have the pleasure, Mademoiselle&mdash;and you,
Monsieur&mdash;of seeing with me what that careless person left
behind him."</p>
<p>He had laid the thing on the table, and now he tapped it,
aggravatingly, with his hand. But the strain was over for me. I
looked on with calmness, and was amazed when at last Maxine flew to
him, no longer scornful, tragically indifferent in her manner, but
imploring&mdash;a weak, agonized woman.</p>
<p>"For the love of God, spare me, Monsieur," she sobbed. "You
don't understand. I confess that what you have there, is mine. I
have held myself high, in my own eyes, and the eyes of the world,
because I&mdash;an actress&mdash;never took a lover. But now I am
like the others. This is my lover. There's the price I put on my
love. Now, Monsieur, I ask you on my womanhood to hold what is in
that leather case sacred."</p>
<p>I felt the blood rush to my face as if she had struck me across
it with a whip. My first thought, to my shame, was a selfish one.
What if this became known, this thing that she had said, and Diana
should hear? Then indeed all hope for me with the girl I loved
would be over. My second thought was for Maxine herself. But she
had sealed my lips. Since she had chosen the way, I could only be
silent.</p>
<p>"Mademoiselle, it is a grief to me that I must refuse such a
prayer, from such a woman. But duty before chivalry. I must see the
contents of that case," said the Commissary of Police.</p>
<p>She caught his hand and rained tears upon it. "No&mdash;no!" she
implored. "If I were rich, I would offer you thousands to spare me.
I've been extravagant&mdash;I haven't saved, but all I have in the
world is yours if&mdash;."</p>
<p>"There can be no such 'if,' Mademoiselle," the man broke in. And
wrenching his hand free, he opened the case before she could again
prevent him.</p>
<p>Out fell a cascade of light, a diamond necklace. It flashed to
the floor, where it lay on one of the sofa cushions, sending up a
spray of rainbow colours.</p>
<p><i>"Sacr&eacute; bleu!"</i> muttered the Frenchman, under his
breath, for whatever he had expected, he had not expected that. But
Maxine spoke not a word. Shorn of hope, as, in spite of her prayers
and tears, the leather case was torn open, she was shorn of
strength as well; and the beautiful, tall figure crumpling like a
flower broken on its stalk, she would have fallen if I had not
caught her, holding her up against my shoulder. When the cataract
of diamonds sprang out of the case, however, I felt her limp body
straighten itself. I felt her pulses leap. I felt her begin to
<i>live</i>. She had drunk a draught of hope and life, and,
fortified by it, was gathering all her scattered forces together
for a new fight, if fight she must again.</p>
<p>The Commissary of Police turned the leather case wrong side out.
It was empty. There had been nothing inside but the necklace: not a
card, not a scrap of paper.</p>
<p>"Where, then, is the document?" Crestfallen, he put the question
half to himself, half to Maxine de Renzie.</p>
<p>"What document?" she asked, too wise to betray relief in voice
or face. Hearing the heavy tone, seeing the shamed face, the
hanging head that lay against my shoulder, who&mdash;knowing a
little less than I did of the truth&mdash;would have dreamed that
in her soul she thanked God for a miracle? Even I would not have
been sure, had I not felt the life stealing back into her half-dead
body.</p>
<p>"The contents of the case are not what I came here to find,"
admitted the Enemy.</p>
<p>"I do not know what you came to find, but you have made me
suffer horribly," said Maxine. "You have been very cruel to a woman
who has done nothing to deserve such humiliation. All pleasure I
might have taken in my diamonds is gone now. I shall never have a
peaceful moment&mdash;never be able to wear them joyfully. I shall
have the thought in my mind that people who look at me will be
saying: 'Every woman has her price. There is the price of Maxine de
Renzie.'"</p>
<p>"You need have no such thought, Mademoiselle," the man
protested. "We shall never speak to anyone except those who will
receive our report, of what we have heard and seen in this
room."</p>
<p>"Won't you search further?" asked Maxine. "Since you seemed to
expect something else&mdash;"</p>
<p>"You would not have had time to conceal more than one thing,
Mademoiselle," said the policeman, with a smile that was faintly
grim. "Besides, this case was what you did not wish us to find. You
are a great actress, but you could not control the dew which sprang
out on your forehead, or the beating of your heart when I touched
the sofa, so I knew: I had been watching you for that. There has
been an error, and I can only apologise."</p>
<p>"I don't blame you, but those who sent you," said Maxine,
letting me lead her to a chair, into which she sank, limply. "I am
thankful you do not tell me these diamonds are contraband in some
way. I was not sure but it would end in that."</p>
<p>"Not at all, Mademoiselle. I wish you joy of them. It is you who
will adorn the jewels, not they you. Again I apologise for myself
and my companions. We have but done our duty."</p>
<p>"I have an enemy, who must have contrived this plot against me,"
exclaimed Maxine, as if on a sudden thought. "It is said that 'Hell
hath no fury like a woman scorned.' But what of a man who has been
scorned&mdash;by a woman? He knew I wanted all my strength for
to-night&mdash;the night of the new play&mdash;and he will be
hoping that this has broken me. But I will not be broken. If you
would atone, Messieurs, for your part in this scene, you will go to
the theatre this evening and encourage me by your applause."</p>
<p>All three bowed. The Commissary of Police, lately so relentless,
murmured compliments. It was all very French, and after what had
passed, gave me the sensation that I was in a dream.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>IVOR HEARS THE STORY</h3>
<p>They were gone. They had closed the door behind them. I looked
at Maxine, but she did not speak. With her finger to her lips she
got up, trembling still; and walking to the door, she opened it
suddenly to look out. Nobody was there.</p>
<p>"They may have gone into your bedroom to listen at that door,"
she whispered.</p>
<p>I took the hint, and going quickly into the room adjoining,
turned on the light. Emptiness there: but I left the door open, and
the electricity switched on. They might change their minds, or be
more subtle than they wished to seem.</p>
<p>Maxine threw herself on the sofa, gathering up the necklace from
the cushion where it had fallen, and lifting it in both hands
pressed the glittering mass against her lips and cheeks.</p>
<p>"Thank God, thank God&mdash;and thank you, Ivor, best of
friends!" she said brokenly, in so low a voice that no ear could
have caught her words, even if pressed against the keyhole. Then,
letting the diamonds drop into her lap, she flung back her head and
laughed and cried together.</p>
<p>"Oh, Ivor, Ivor!" she panted, between her sobs and hysterical
gusts of laughter. "The agony of it&mdash;the agony&mdash;and the
joy now! You're wonderful. Good, precious Ivor&mdash;dear
friend&mdash;saint."</p>
<p>At this I laughed too, partly to calm her, and patted gently the
hands with which she had nervously clutched my sleeve.</p>
<p>"Heaven knows I don't deserve one of those epithets," I said,
"I'll just stick to friend."</p>
<p>"Not deserve them?" she repeated. "Not deserve them, when you've
saved me&mdash;I don't yet understand how&mdash;from a horror worse
than death&mdash;oh, but a thousand times worse, for I wanted to
die. I meant to die. If they had found it, I shouldn't have lived
to see to-morrow morning. Tell me&mdash;how did you work such a
miracle? How did you get this necklace, that meant so much to me
(and to one I love), and how did you hide the&mdash;other
thing?"</p>
<p>"I don't know anything about this necklace," I answered,
stupidly, "I didn't bring it."</p>
<p>"You&mdash;<i>didn't bring it</i>?"</p>
<p>"No. At least, that red leather thing isn't the case I carried.
When the fellow pulled it out from the sofa, I saw it wasn't what
I'd had, so I thanked our lucky stars, and would have tried to let
you know that all hope wasn't over, if I'd dared to catch your eye
or make a signal."</p>
<p>Maxine was suddenly calm. The tears had dried on her cheeks, and
her eyes were fever-bright.</p>
<p>"Ivor, you can't know what you are talking about," she said, in
a changed voice. "That red leather case is what you took out of
your breast pocket and handed to me when I first came into the
room. At the sound of the knock, I pushed it down as far as I could
between the seat and back of the sofa, and then ran off to a
distance before the door opened. You <i>did</i> bring the necklace,
knowingly or not; and as it was the cause of all my trouble in the
beginning, I needn't tell you of the joy I had in seeing it, apart
from the heavenly relief of being spared discovery of the thing I
feared. Now, when you've given me the other packet, which you hid
so marvellously, I can go away happy."</p>
<p>I stared at her, feeling more than ever like one in a dream.</p>
<p>"I gave you the only thing I brought," I said. "It was in my
breast pocket, inside my coat. I took it out, and put it in your
hands. There was no other thing. Look again in the sofa. It must be
there still. This red case is something else&mdash;we can try to
account for it later. It all came through the lights not working.
If it hadn't been dusk you would have seen that I gave you a dark
green leather letter-case&mdash;quite different from this, though
of about the same length&mdash;rather less thick, and&mdash;"</p>
<p>Frantically she began ransacking the crevice between the seat
and back of the sofa, but nothing was there. We might have known
there could be nothing or the Commissary of Police would have been
before us. With a cry she cut me short at last throwing up her
hands in despair. She was deathly pale again, and all the light had
gone out of her eyes leaving them dull as if she had been sick with
some long illness.</p>
<p>"What will become of me?" she stammered. "The treaty lost! My
God&mdash;what shall I do? Ivor, you are killing me. Do you
know&mdash;you are killing me?"</p>
<p>The word "treaty" was new to me in this connection, for the
Foreign Secretary had not thought it necessary that his messenger
should be wholly in his secrets&mdash;and Maxine's. Yet hearing the
word brought no great surprise. I knew that I had been cat's-paw in
some game of high stakes. But it was of Maxine I thought now, and
the importance of the loss to her, not the national disaster which
it might well be also.</p>
<p>"Wait," I said, "don't despair yet. There's some mistake.
Perhaps we shall be able to see light when we've thrashed this out
and talked it over. I know I had a green letter-case. It never left
my pocket. I thought of it and guarded it every moment. Could those
diamonds have been inside it? Could the Foreign Secretary had given
me the necklace, <i>instead</i> of what you expected?"</p>
<p>"No, no," she answered with desperate impatience. "He knew that
the only thing which could save me was the document I'd sent him. I
wired that I must have it back again immediately, for my own
sake&mdash;for his&mdash;for the sake of England. Ivor! Think
again. Do you want me to go mad?"</p>
<p>"I will think," I said, trying to speak reassuringly. "Give me a
moment&mdash;a quiet moment&mdash;"</p>
<p>"A quiet moment," she repeated, bitterly, "when for me each
second is an hour! It's late, and this is the night of my new play.
Soon, I must be at the theatre, for the make-up and dressing of
this part for the first act are a heavy business. I don't want all
Paris to know that Maxine de Renzie has been ruined by her enemies.
Let us keep the secret while we can, for others' sakes, and so gain
time for our own, if all is not lost&mdash;if you believe still
that there's any hope. Oh, save me, Ivor&mdash;somehow. My whole
life is in this."</p>
<p>"Let your understudy take your part to-night, while we think,
and work," I suggested. "You cannot go to the theatre in this
state."</p>
<p>"For an actress there's no such word as 'cannot,'" she said
bitterly. "I could play a part to the finish, and crawl off the
stage to die the next instant; yet no one would have guessed that I
was dying. I have no understudy. What use to have one? What
audience would stop in the theatre after an announcement that their
Maxine's understudy would take her place? Every man and woman would
walk out and get his money back. No; for the sake of the man I love
better than my life, or twenty lives&mdash;the man I've either
saved or ruined&mdash;I'll play tonight, if I go mad or kill myself
to-morrow. Don't 'think quietly,' Ivor. Think out aloud, and let me
follow the workings of your mind. We may help each other, so. Let
us go over together everything that happened to you from the minute
you took the letter-case from the Foreign Secretary up to the
minute I came into this room."</p>
<p>I obeyed, beginning at the very beginning and telling her all,
except the part that had to do with Diana Forrest. She had no
concern in that. I told her how I had slept with the green
letter-case under my pillow, and had waked to feel and look for it
once or twice an hour. How when morning came I had been late in
getting to the train: how I had struggled with the two men who
tried to keep me out of the reserved compartment into which they
were intruding. How the man who had a right to it, after wishing to
prevent my entering, helped me in the end, rather than be alone
with the pair who had forced themselves upon him. How he had
stumbled almost into my arms in a panic, during the confusion after
the false alarm on the boat's gangway. How he had walked beside me
and seemed on the point of speaking, later, in the Gare du Nord.
How I had avoided and lost sight of him; but how I had many times
covertly touched my pocket to be sure that, through all, the
letter-case was still safe there.</p>
<p>Maxine grew calmer, though not, I think, more hopeful as I
talked; and at last she folded up the diamonds neatly in the red
case, which she gave to me. "Put that into the same pocket," she
said, "and then pass your hand over your coat, as you did often
before. Now, does it feel exactly as if it were the green
letter-case with which you started out?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I think it does," I answered, doubtfully. "I'm afraid I
shouldn't know the difference. This <i>may</i> be a little thicker
than the other, but&mdash;I can't be sure. And, you see, I never
once had a chance to unbutton my coat and look at the thing I had
in this inner pocket. It would have attracted too much attention to
risk that; and as a matter of fact, I was especially warned not to
do it. I could trust only to the touch. But even granting that, by
a skill almost clever enough for sleight of hand&mdash;a skill
which only the smartest pickpocket in Europe could
possess&mdash;why should a thief who had stolen my letter-case give
me instead a string of diamonds worth many thousands of pounds? If
he wanted to put something into my pocket of much the same size and
shape as the thing he stole, so that I shouldn't suspect my loss,
why didn't he slip in the red case <i>empty</i>, instead of
containing the necklace?"</p>
<p>"<i>This</i> necklace, too, of all things in the world!"
murmured Maxine, lost in the mystery. "It's like a dream. Yet
here&mdash;by some miracle&mdash;it is, in our hands. And the
treaty is gone."</p>
<p>"The treaty is gone," I repeated, miserably.</p>
<p>It was Maxine herself who had spoken the words which I merely
echoed, yet it almost killed her to hear them from me. No doubt it
gave the dreadful fact a kind of inevitability. She flung herself
down on the sofa with a groan, her face buried in her hands.</p>
<p>"My God, what a punishment!" she stammered. "I've ruined the man
I risked everything to save. I will go to the theatre, and I will
act to-night, my friend, but unless you can give me back what is
lost, when to-morrow morning comes, I shall be out of the
world."</p>
<p>"Don't say that," I implored, sick with pity for her and shame
at my failure. "All hope isn't over yet; it can't be. I'll think
this out. There must be a solution. There must be a way of laying
hold of what <i>seems</i> to be gone. If by giving my life I could
get it, I assure you I wouldn't hesitate for an instant, now: so
you see, there's nothing I won't do to help you. Only, I wish the
path could be made a little plainer for me&mdash;unless for some
reason it's necessary for you to keep me in the dark. The word
'treaty' I heard for the first time from you. I didn't know what I
was bringing you, except that it was a document of international
importance, and that you'd been helping the British Foreign
Secretary&mdash;perhaps Great Britain as a Power&mdash;in some
ticklish manoeuvre of high politics. He said that, so far as he was
concerned, you might tell me more if you liked. He left it to you.
That was his message."</p>
<p>"Then I will tell you more!" Maxine exclaimed. "It will be
better to do so. I know that it will make it easier for you to help
me. The document you were bringing me was a treaty&mdash;a quite
new treaty between Japan, Russia and France: not a copy, but the
original. England had been warned that there was a secret
understanding between the three countries, unknown to her. There
was no time to make a copy. And I stole the real treaty from Raoul
du Laurier, to whom I am engaged&mdash;whom I adore, Ivor, as I
didn't know it was in me to adore any man. You know his name,
perhaps&mdash;that he's Under Secretary in the Foreign Office, here
in Paris. Oh, I can read in your eyes what you're thinking of me,
now. You can't think worse of me than I think of myself. Yet I did
the thing for Raoul's sake. There's that in my defence&mdash;only
that."</p>
<p>"I don't understand," I said, trying not to show the horror of
Maxine's treachery to a man who loved and trusted her, which I
could not help feeling.</p>
<p>"How could you?&mdash;except that I've betrayed him! But I'll
tell you everything&mdash;I'll go back a long way. Then you'll pity
me, even if you scorn me, too. You'll work for me&mdash;to save me,
and him. For years I've helped the British Government. Oh, I won't
spare myself. I've been a spy, sometimes against one Power,
sometimes against another. When there was anything to do against
Russia, I was always glad, because my dear father was a Pole, and
you know how Poles feel towards Russia. Russia ruined his life, and
stripped it of everything worth having, not only money,
but&mdash;oh, well, that's not in this story of mine! I won't
trouble you or waste time in the telling. Only, when I was a very
young girl, I was already the enemy of all that's Russian, with a
big debt of revenge to pay. And I've been paying it, slowly. Don't
think that the money I've had for my work&mdash;hateful work
often&mdash;has been used for myself. It's been for my father's
country&mdash;poor, sad country&mdash;every shilling of English
coin. As an actress I've supported myself, and, as an actress, it
has been easier for me to do the other secret work than it would
have been for a woman leading a more sheltered life, mingling less
with distinguished persons of different countries, or unable to be
eccentric without causing scandal. As for France, she's the friend
of Russia, and I haven't a drop of French blood in my veins, so, at
least, I've never been treacherous to my own people. Oh, I have
made some great <i>coups</i> in the last eight or nine years,
Ivor!... for I began before I was sixteen, and now I'm twenty-six.
Once or twice England has had to thank me for giving her news of
the most vital importance. You're shocked to hear what my inner
life has been?"</p>
<p>"If I were shocked, no doubt the feeling would be more than half
conventional. One hardly knows how conventional one's opinions are
until one stops to think," said I.</p>
<p>"Once, I gloried in the work," Maxine went on. "But that was
before I fell in love. You and I have played a little at being in
love, but that was to pass the time. Both of us were flirting. I'd
never met Raoul then, and I've never really loved any man except
him. It came at first sight, for me: and when he told me that he
cared, he said it had begun when he first saw me on the stage; so
you see it is as if we were meant for each other. From the moment I
gave him my promise, I promised myself that the old work should be
given up for ever: Raoul's <i>fianc&eacute;e</i>, Raoul's wife,
should not be the tool of diplomatists. Besides, as he's a
Frenchman, his wife would owe loyalty to France, which Maxine de
Renzie never owed. I wanted&mdash;oh, how much I wanted&mdash;to be
only what Raoul believed me, just a simple, true-hearted woman,
with nothing to hide. It made me sick to think that there was one
thing I must always conceal from him, but I did the best I could. I
vowed to myself that I'd break with the past, and I wrote a letter
to the British Foreign Secretary, who has always been a good friend
of mine. I said I was engaged, and hoped to begin my life all over
again in a different way, though he might be sure that I'd know how
to keep his secrets as well as my own. Oh, Ivor, to think that was
hardly more than a week ago! I was happy then. I feel twenty years
older now."</p>
<p>"A week ago. You've been engaged only a week?" I broke in.</p>
<p>"Not many days more. I guessed, I hoped, long ago that Raoul
cared, but he wouldn't have told me, even the day he did tell, if
he hadn't lost his head a little. He hadn't meant to speak, it
seems, for he's poor, and he thought he had no right. But what's a
man worth who doesn't lose his head when he loves a woman? I adored
him for it. We decided not to let anyone know until a few weeks
before we could marry, as I didn't care to have my engagement
gossipped about, for months on end. There were reasons
why&mdash;more than one: but the man of all others whom I didn't
want to know the truth found out, or, rather, suspected what had
happened, the very day when Raoul and I came to an
understanding&mdash;Count Godensky of the Russian Embassy. He
called, and was let in by mistake while Raoul was with me, and,
just as he must have seen by our faces that there was something to
suspect, so I saw by his that he did suspect. Oh, a hateful person!
I've refused him three times. There are some men so vain that they
can never believe a woman really means to say 'no' to them. Count
Godensky is one of those, and he's dangerous, too. I'm afraid of
him, since I've cared for Raoul, though I used to be afraid of no
one, when I'd only myself to think of. Raoul was going away that
very night. He had an errand to do for a woman who was a dear and
intimate friend of his dead mother. You must know of the Duchesse
de Montpellier? Well, it was for her: and Raoul is like her son.
She has no children of her own."</p>
<p>"I don't know her," I said, "but I've seen her; a charming
looking woman, about forty-five, with a gloomy-faced
husband&mdash;a fellow who might be rather a Tartar to live with.
They were pointed out to me at Monte Carlo one year, in the Casino,
where the Duchess seemed to be enjoying herself hugely, though the
Duke had the air of being dragged in against his will."</p>
<p>"No doubt he had been&mdash;or else he was there to fetch her
out. Poor dear, she's a dreadful gambler. It's in her blood! I She
lost, I don't know how much, at Monte Carlo on an 'infallible
system' she had. She's afraid of her husband, though she loves him
immensely; and lately a craze she's had for Bridge has cost her so
much that she daren't tell the Duke, who hates her gambling. She
confessed to Raoul, and begged him to help her&mdash;not with
money, for he has none, but by taking a famous and wonderful
diamond necklace of hers to Amsterdam, selling the stones for her
there, and having them replaced with paste. It was all to be done
very secretly, of course, so that the Duke shouldn't know, and
Raoul hated it, but he couldn't refuse. He had no idea of telling
me this story, that day when he 'lost his head,' while we were
bidding each other good-bye before his journey. He didn't mention
the name of the Duchess, but said only that he had leave, and was
going to Holland on business. But while he was away a
<i>dreadful</i> thing happened&mdash;the most ghastly
misfortune&mdash;and as we were engaged to be married, he felt
obliged when he came back to let me know the worst."</p>
<p>"What was the dreadful thing that happened?" I asked, as she
paused, pressing her hands against her temples.</p>
<p>"The necklace was stolen from Raoul by a thief, who must have
been one of the most expert in the world. Can you imagine Raoul's
feelings? He came to me in despair, asking my advice. What was he
to do? He dared not appeal to the police, or the Duchess's secret
would come out. And he couldn't bear to tell her of the loss, not
only because it would be such a blow to her, as she was depending
on the money from the sale of the jewels, but because she knew that
he was in some difficulties, and <i>might</i> be tempted to believe
that he'd only pretended the diamonds were stolen&mdash;while
really he'd sold them for his own use."</p>
<p>"As she's fond of him, and trusts him, probably she would have
thought no such thing," I tried to comfort Maxine. "But certainly,
it was a rather bad fix."</p>
<p>"Rather bad fix! Oh, you laconic creatures, Englishmen. All you
think of is to hide your feelings behind icy words. As for
me&mdash;well, there was nothing I wouldn't have done to help
him&mdash;nothing. My life would have been a small thing to give. I
would have given my soul. And already a thought came flashing into
my mind. I begged Raoul to wait, and say nothing to the Duchess,
who didn't even know yet that he'd come back from Amsterdam. The
thought in my mind was about the commission from your Secretary for
Foreign Affairs. As I told you, I'd just sent him word in the usual
cypher and through the usual channels, that I couldn't do what he
wanted. He'd offered me eight thousand pounds to undertake the
service, and four more if I succeeded. I believed I could succeed
if I tried. And with the few thousands I'd saved up, and selling
such jewels as I had, I could make up the sum Raoul had been told
to ask for the necklace. Then he could give it to the Duchess, and
she need never know that the diamonds had been stolen. All that
night I lay awake thinking, thinking. Next day, at a time when I
knew Raoul would be working in his office, I went to see him there,
and cheered him up as well as I could. I told him that in a few
days I hoped to have eighteen or twenty thousand pounds in my
hands&mdash;all for him. To let him have the money would make me
happier than I'd ever been. At first he said he wouldn't take it
from me&mdash;I knew he would say that! But, at last, after I'd
cried and begged, and persuaded, he consented; only it was to be a
loan, and some how, some time, he would pay me back. In that office
there are several great safes; and when we had grown quite happy
and gay together, I made Raoul tell me which was the most important
of all&mdash;where the really sacred and valuable things were kept.
He laughed and pointed out the most interesting one&mdash;the one,
he said, which held all the deepest secrets of French foreign
diplomacy. I was sure then that the thing I had to get for the
British Foreign Secretary must be there, though it was such a new
thing that it couldn't have been anywhere for long. 'There are
three keys to that safe,' said Raoul. 'One is kept by the
President; one is always with the Foreign Secretary; this is the
third'; and he showed me a strange little key different to any I
had seen before. 'Oh, do let me have a peep at these wonderful
papers,' I pleaded with him. Before coming I had planned what to
do. Round my throat I wore a string of imitation pearls, which I'd
put on for a special purpose. But they were pretty, and so well
made that only an expert would know they weren't real. Raoul isn't
an expert; so at the moment he fitted the key into the lock of the
safe to open the door, I gave a sly little pull, and broke the
thread, making the pearls roll everywhere about the floor. He was
quite distressed, forgot all about the key in the lock, and flew to
pick up the pearls as if each one were worth at least a thousand
francs.</p>
<p>"While he was busy finding the lost beads, I whipped out the
key, took an impression of it on a piece of wax I had ready,
concealed in my handkerchief, and slipped it back into the lock
while he was still on his hands and knees on the floor. Then he
opened the safe-door for a moment, just to give me the peep I had
begged for, but not long enough for me to touch anything even if
I'd dared to try with him standing there. Enough, though, to show
me that the documents were neatly arranged in labelled
pigeon-holes, and to see their general character, colour, and
shape. That same day a key to fit the lock was being made; and when
it was ready, I made an excuse to call again on Raoul at the
office. Not that a very elaborate excuse was needed. The poor
fellow, trusting me as he trusts himself, or more, was only too
glad to have me come to him, even in that sacred place. Now, the
thing was to get him away. But I'd made up my mind what to do. In
another office, upstairs, was a friend of Raoul's&mdash;the one who
introduced us to each other, and I'd made up a message for him,
which I begged Raoul to take, and bring his friend to speak to me.
He went, and I believed I might count on five minutes to myself. No
more&mdash;but those five minutes would have to be enough for
success or failure. The instant the door shut behind Raoul, I was
at the safe. The key fitted. I snatched out a folded document, and
opened it to make quite, quite certain it was the right one, for a
mistake would be inexcusable and spoil everything. It was what I
wanted&mdash;the treaty, newly made, between Japan, Russia and
France&mdash;the treaty which your Foreign Secretary thought he had
reason to believe was a secret one, arranged between the three
countries without the knowledge of England and to the prejudice of
her interests. The one glance I had gave me the impression that the
document was nothing of the kind, but quite innocent, affecting
trade only; yet that wasn't my business. I had to send it to the
Foreign Secretary, who wanted to know its precise nature, and
whether England was being deceived. In place of the treaty I
slipped into its pigeon-hole a document I'd brought with
me&mdash;just like the real thing. No one opening the safe on other
business would suspect the change that had been made. My hope was
to get the treaty back before it should be missed. You see, I was
betraying Raoul, to save him. Do you understand?"</p>
<p>"I understand. You must have persuaded yourself that you were
justified. But, good Heavens, Maxine," I couldn't help breaking
out, "it was an awful thing to do."</p>
<p>"I know&mdash;I know. But I had to have the money&mdash;for
Raoul. And there was no other way to get it. You remember, I'd
refused, till the diamonds were lost, and would have refused even
if Raoul had nothing to do with the French Foreign Office. But let
me go on telling you what happened. I had time enough. I had even a
minute or two to spare. And fortunately for me, the man I'd sent
Raoul to find was out. I looked at my watch, pretended to be
surprised, and said I must go at once. I couldn't bear to waste a
second in hurrying the treaty off, so that it might the more
quickly be on its way back. I hadn't come to visit Raoul in my own
carriage, but in a cab, which was waiting. As Raoul was taking me
to it, Count Godensky got out of a motor-brougham, and saw me. If
only it had been anywhere except in front of the Foreign Office! I
told myself there was no reason why he should guess that anything
was wrong, but I was in such a state of nerves that, as he raised
his hat, and his eyebrows, I fancied that he imagined all sorts of
things, and I felt myself grow red and pale. What a fool I
was&mdash;and how weak! But I couldn't help it. I didn't wait to go
home. I wrote a few lines in the cab, and sent off the packet,
registered, in time I hoped, to catch the post&mdash;but after all,
it didn't. Coming out from the post office, there was Godensky
again, in his motor-brougham. <i>That</i> could have been no
coincidence. A horrid certainty sprang to life in me that he'd
followed my cab from the Foreign Office, to see where I would go.
Why couldn't I have thought of that danger? I have always thought
of things, and guarded against them; yet this time, this time of
all others, I seemed fated."</p>
<p>"But if Godensky had known what you were doing, the game would
have been up for you before this," I said.</p>
<p>"He didn't know, of course. Only&mdash;if he wants to be a
woman's lover and she won't have him, he's her enemy and he's the
enemy of the man who <i>is</i> her lover. He's too clever and too
careful of his own interests to speak out prematurely anything he
might vaguely suspect, for it would do him harm if he proved
mistaken. He wouldn't yet, I think, even warn those whom it might
concern, to search and see if anything in Raoul's charge were out
of order or missing. But what he would do, what I think he has
done, is this. Having some idea, as he may have, that my relations
with certain important persons in England are rather friendly, and
seeing me come from the Foreign Office to go almost straight to the
post, it might have occurred to him to try and learn the name of my
correspondent. He has influence&mdash;he could perhaps have found
out: but if he did, it wouldn't have helped him much, for
naturally, my dealings with the British Foreign Secretary are
always well under cover&mdash;hence a delay sometimes in his
receiving word from me. What I send can never go straight to him,
as you may guess. Godensky would guess that, too: and he would have
perhaps informed the police, very cautiously, very unofficially and
confidentially, that he suspected Maxine de Renzie of being a
political spy in the pay of England. He would have advised that my
movements be watched for the next few days: that English agents of
the French police be warned to watch also, on their side of the
Channel. He would have argued to himself that if I'd sent any
document away, with Raoul's connivance or without, I would be
wanting it back as soon as possible; and he would have mentioned to
the police that possibly a messenger would bring me
something&mdash;if my correspondence through the post was found to
contain nothing compromising. Oh, there have been eyes on me, and
on every movement of mine, I'm sure. See how efficient, though
quiet, the methods have been where you're concerned. They&mdash;the
police&mdash;knew the name of the man I was to meet here at this
hotel; and if, as Godensky must have hoped, any document belonging
to the French Government had been found on you or me, everything
would have played into his hands. Raoul would have been ruined, his
heart broken, and I&mdash;but there are no words to express what I
would have suffered, what I may yet have to suffer. Godensky would
be praised for his cleverness, as well as securing a satisfactory
revenge on me for refusing him. The only thing which rejoices me
now is the thought of his blank disappointment when he gets the
news from the Commissary of Police."</p>
<p>"You don't believe then," I asked, "that Godensky has had any
hand in the disappearance of the treaty?"</p>
<p>"I would believe it, if it weren't for the necklace being put in
its place. Even if Count Godensky could have known of Raoul's
mission with the diamonds, and got them into his own hands, he
wouldn't have let them get out again with every chance of their
going back to Raoul, and thus saving him from his trouble. He'd do
nothing to help, but everything to hinder. There lies the
mystery&mdash;in the return of the necklace instead of the treaty.
You have no knowledge of it, you tell me; yet you come to me with
it in your pocket&mdash;the necklace stolen from Raoul du Laurier,
days ago, in Amsterdam or on the way there."</p>
<p>"You're certain it's the same?"</p>
<p>"Certain as that you are you, and I am I. And I'm not out of my
mind yet&mdash;though I soon shall be, unless you somehow save me
from this horror."</p>
<p>"I'm going to try," I said. "Don't give up hope. I wish, though,
that you hadn't to act to-night."</p>
<p>"So do I. But there's no way out of it. And I must go now to the
theatre, or I shall be late: my make-up's a heavy one, and takes a
long time. I can't afford to have any talk about me and my affairs
to-night, whatever comes afterwards. Raoul will be in a box, and at
the end of the first act, he'll be at the door of my dressing-room.
The agony of seeing him, of hearing him praise my acting, and
saying dear, trusting, loving words that would make me almost too
happy, if I hadn't betrayed him, ruined his career for ever!"</p>
<p>"Maybe not," I said. "And anyhow, there's the necklace. That's
something."</p>
<p>"Yes, that's something."</p>
<p>"Will Godensky be in the audience, too?" I asked.</p>
<p>"I'm sure he will. He couldn't keep away. But he may be late. He
won't come until he's had a long talk with the Commissary of
Police, and tried to thrash matters out."</p>
<p>"If only your theory's right, then,&mdash;if he hasn't dared yet
to throw suspicion on du Laurier, and if the loss of that
letter-case with its contents is as much of a mystery to him as it
is to us, we have a little time before us still: we're
comparatively safe for a few hours."</p>
<p>"We're as safe," answered Maxine, with a kind of desperate
calmness, "as if we were in a house with gunpowder stored
underneath, and a train laid to fire it. But"&mdash;she broke off
bitterly, "why do I say '<i>we</i>'. To you all this can be no more
than a regret, a worry."</p>
<p>"You know that's not just!" I reproached her. "I'm in this with
you now, heart and soul. I spoke no more than the truth when I said
I'd give my life, if necessary, to redeem my failure. Already I've
given something, but&mdash;"</p>
<p>"What have you given?" she caught me up quickly.</p>
<p>"My hope of happiness with a girl I love as you love du
Laurier," I answered; then regretted my words and would have taken
them back if I could, for she had a heavy enough burden to bear
already, without helping me bear mine.</p>
<p>"I don't understand," she said.</p>
<p>"Don't think of it. You can do nothing; and I don't grudge the
sacrifice&mdash;or anything," I hurried on.</p>
<p>"Yet I will think of it, if I ever have time to think of
anything beyond this tangle. But now, it must be <i>au revoir</i>.
Save me, save Raoul, if you can, Ivor. What you can do, I don't
know. I'm groping in darkness. Yet you're my one hope. For pity's
sake, come to my house when the play's over, to tell me what you've
done, if you've been able to do anything. Be there at twelve."</p>
<p>"I promise."</p>
<p>"Thank you. I shall live for that moment. Now, give me the
diamonds, and I'll go. I don't want you to be seen with me outside
this room."</p>
<p>I gave her the necklace, and she was at the door before I could
open it.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>IVOR IS LATE FOR AN APPOINTMENT</h3>
<p>I was glad to be alone, for as I had said, I wanted to think
quietly.</p>
<p>Maxine had taken the diamonds, but she had slipped the necklace
into the bosom of her dress, pressing it down through the rather
low-cut opening at the throat, and had therefore left the leather
case. I picked the thing up from the table where she had thrown it,
and examined it carefully for the first time.</p>
<p>It had not been originally intended as a jewel-case, that was
clear; and as Maxine's voice had rung unmistakably true when she
denied all previous knowledge of it to the police, I judged that
the diamonds had not been in it when the Duchess entrusted them to
du Laurier. He would almost certainly have described to Maxine the
box or case which had been stolen from him, and if the thing pulled
out from the sofa-hiding-place had recalled his description, she
must have betrayed some emotion under the keen eyes of the
Commissary of Police.</p>
<p>The case which, it seemed, I had brought to Paris, looked as if
it might have been made to hold a peculiar kind of cigar, much
longer than the ordinary sort. Within, on either side, was a
partition, and there was a silver clasp on which the hallmark was
English.</p>
<p>"English silver!" I said to myself, thoughtfully. The three men
who had travelled in the carriage with me from London to Dover were
all English. Of the trio, only the nervous little fellow who had
reserved the compartment for himself had found the smallest
possible opportunity to steal the treaty from me, and exchange for
it this red leather case containing a diamond necklace worth twenty
thousand pounds. If he possessed the skill and quick deftness of a
conjurer or a marvellously clever professional pickpocket, as well
as the incentive of a paid spy, he might conceivably have done the
trick at the moment of alarm on the boat's gangway, not afterwards;
for when he had pressed near me in the Gare du Nord he had been on
the wrong side. But for my life I could not guess the motive for
such an exchange.</p>
<p>Supposing him a spy, employed to track and rob me of what I
carried, why should he have made me a present of these rare and
precious diamonds? Would the bribe for which he used his skill
reach anything like the sum he could obtain by selling the stones?
I was almost sure it would not; and therefore, having the diamonds,
it would have been far more to his advantage to keep them than to
stuff them into my pocket, simply to fill up the space where the
case with the treaty had lain. There would not have been time yet
for the real diamonds to have been copied in Amsterdam, therefore
it would be useless to build up a theory that the stones given me
might be false.</p>
<p>Besides, I reminded myself, if the man were a spy whose business
was to watch and be near me, why hadn't he waited to see what I
would do, where I would go, instead of taking a compartment,
carefully reserving it, and trusting to such an unlikely chance as
that I might force myself into it with him? Even if the three men
had been in some obscure way playing into each others' hands, I
could not see how their game had been arranged to catch me.</p>
<p>Maxine and I had talked for a long time, but not two hours had
passed yet since I saw the last of the little rat of a man in the
railway-station. Though I could not understand any reason for his
tricking me, still I told myself that nobody else could have done
it, and I decided to go back at once to the Gare du Nord. There I
might still be able to find some trace of the little man and of my
two other fellow-travellers. If through a porter or cabman I could
learn where they had gone, I might have a chance even now of
getting back the stolen treaty. I had brought with me from London a
loaded revolver, warned by the Foreign Secretary that to do so
would be a wise precaution; and I was ready to make use of it if
necessary.</p>
<p>I was beginning to be very hungry, but that was a detail of no
importance, for I had no time to waste in eating. I went to the
railway-station and looked about until I found a porter whose face
I had seen when I got out of the train. He had, in fact, appeared
under the window of my compartment, offering himself as a luggage
carrier and had been close behind me when my late travelling
companion walked by my side. Questioned, he appeared not to
remember; but his wits being sharpened by the gift of a franc, he
reflected and recalled not only my features but the features of the
little man, whom he described with sufficient accuracy. What had
become of <i>le petit Monsieur</i> he was not certain, but fancied
he had eventually driven away in a cab accompanied by two other
gentlemen. He recollected this circumstance, because the face of
the cabman was one that he knew; and it was now again in the
station, for the <i>voiture</i> had returned. Would he point out
the <i>cocher</i> to me? He would, and did, receiving a second
franc for his pains.</p>
<p>The cab driver proved to be a dull and surly fellow, like many
another <i>cocher</i> of Paris, but the clink of silver and the
sight of it mellowed him. I began by saying that I was in search of
three friends of mine whom I was to have met when the boat train
came in, but whom I had unfortunately missed. I asked him to
describe the men he had driven away from the station at that time,
and though he did it clumsily, betraying an irritating lack of
observation when it came to details, still such information as I
could draw from him sounded encouraging. He remembered perfectly
well the place at which he had deposited his three passengers, and
I decided to take the risk of following them.</p>
<p>When I say "risk," I mean the risk that the man I was starting
to chase might turn out not to be the man I wished to follow.
Besides, as they had been driven to Neuilly, the distance was so
great that, if I went there in a cab, and found at last that I had
made a mistake, I should have wasted a great deal of valuable time
on the wrong tack. If the driver had remembered the name of the
street, and the number of the house at which he had paused, I would
have hired a motor and flashed out to the place in a few minutes;
but, despite a suggested bribe, he could say no more than that,
when he had come to a certain place, one of his passengers had
called, "Turn down the next street, to the left." He had done so,
and in front of a house, almost midway along that street, he had
been bidden to stop. He had not bothered to look at the name of the
street; but, though he was not very familiar with that
neighbourhood, various landmarks would guide him to the right
place, when he came to pass them again.</p>
<p>Having heard all he had to say, I reluctantly made up my mind
that I could do no better than take the man as my conductor; and
accordingly, with a horse already tired, I drove to Neuilly. There,
the landmarks were not deceiving, as I was half afraid they would
be; and in a quiet street of the suburb, we stopped at last before
a fair-sized house with lights in many windows. Evidently it was a
<i>pension</i>.</p>
<p>Of the man-servant who answered my ring, I enquired if three
English gentlemen had lately arrived. He replied that they had, and
were dining. Would Monsieur give himself the pain of waiting a few
minutes, until dinner should be over?</p>
<p>My answer was to slip a five franc piece into the servant's
hand, and suggest that I should be shown at once into the
dining-room, without waiting.</p>
<p>My idea was to catch my birds while they fed, and take them by
surprise, lest they fly away. If I pounced upon them in the midst
of a meal, at least they could not escape before being recognised
by me: and as to what should come after recognition, the moment of
meeting must decide.</p>
<p>The five franc piece worked like a charm. I was promptly ushered
into the dining-room, and standing just inside the door, I swept
the long table with a quick, eager glance. About eighteen or twenty
people were dining, but, though several were unmistakably English,
I saw no one who resembled my travelling companions.</p>
<p>Everyone turned and stared. There was no face of which I had not
a good view. In a low voice I asked the servant which were the new
arrivals of whom he had spoken. He pointed them out, and added
that, though they had come only that day from England, they were
old patrons, well known in the house.</p>
<p>As I lingered, deeply disappointed, the elderly proprietor of
the <i>pension</i>, who superintended the comfort of his guests,
trotted fussily up to enquire the stranger's business in his
dining-room. I explained that I had hoped to find friends, and was
so polite that I contrived to get permission for my cabman to have
a peep through the crack of the door. When he had identified his
three passengers, all hope was over. I had followed the wrong
men.</p>
<p>There was nothing to do but go back to the Gare du Nord, and
question more porters and cabmen. Nobody could give me any
information worth having, it seemed; yet the little man must have
left the station in a vehicle of some sort, as he had a great deal
of small luggage. Since I could learn nothing of him or his
movements, however, and dared not, because of Maxine and the
British Foreign Secretary, apply to the police for help, I
determined to lose no more time before consulting a private
detective, a man whose actions I could control, and to whom I need
tell only as much of the truth as I chose, without fear of having
the rest dragged out of me.</p>
<p>At my own hotel I enquired of the manager where I could find a
good private detective, got an address, and motored to it, the
speed bracing my nerves. Fortunately, (as I thought then) Monsieur
Anatole Girard was at home and able to receive me. I was shown into
the plain but very neat little sitting-room of a flat on the fifth
floor of a big new apartment house, and was impressed at first
glance by the clever face of the dark, thin Frenchman who politely
bade me welcome. It was cunning, as well as clever, no doubt: but
then, I told myself, it was the business of a person in Monsieur
Girard's profession to be cunning.</p>
<p>I introduced myself as Mr. Sanford, the name I had been told to
give at the &Eacute;lys&eacute;e Palace Hotel. This seemed best, as
it was in the hotel that I had been recommended to Monsieur Girard,
and complications might arise if George Sandford suddenly turned
into Ivor Dundas. Besides, as there were a good many things which I
did not want brought to light, Sandford seemed the man to fit the
situation. Later, he could easily disappear and leave no trace.</p>
<p>I said that I had been robbed of a thing which was of immense
value to me, but as it was the gift of a lady whose name must not
on any account appear in the case, I did not wish to consult the
police. All I asked of Monsieur Girard's well-known ability was the
discovery of the supposed thief, whom I thereupon described. I
added the fact that we had travelled together, mentioned the
incident at the gangway, and explained that I had not suspected my
loss until I arrived at the &Eacute;lys&eacute;e Palace Hotel.</p>
<p>Girard listened quietly, evidently realising that I talked to
him from behind a screen of reserve, yet not seeking to force me to
put aside that screen. He asked several intelligent questions, very
much to the point, and I answered them&mdash;as seemed best. When
he touched on points which I considered too delicate to be handled
by a stranger, even a detective in my employ, I frankly replied
that they had nothing to do with the case in hand. Shrugging his
shoulders almost imperceptibly, yet expressively, he took my
refusals without comment; and merely bowed when I said that, if the
scoundrel could be unearthed within twenty-four hours, I would pay
a hundred pounds: if within twelve, a hundred and fifty: if within
six, two hundred. I added that there was not a second to waste, as
the fellow might slip out of Paris at any minute; but whatever
happened, Monsieur Girard was to keep the matter quiet.</p>
<p>The detective promised to do his best, (which was said to be
very good), held out hopes of success, and assured me of his
discretion. On the whole, I was pleased with him. He looked like a
man who thoroughly knew his business; and had it not been for the
solemn warning of the Foreign Secretary, and the risk for Maxine, I
would gladly have put more efficient weapons in Girard's hands, by
telling him everything.</p>
<p>By the time that the detective had been primed with such facts
and details as I could give, it was past ten o'clock. I could see
my way to do nothing more for the moment, and as I was half
famished, I whizzed back in my hired automobile to the
&Eacute;lys&eacute;e Palace Hotel. There I had food served in my
own sitting-room, lest George Sandford should chance inconveniently
upon some acquaintance of Ivor Dundas, in the restaurant. I did not
hurry over the meal, for all I wanted now was to arrive at Maxine
de Renzie's house at twelve o'clock, and tell her my news&mdash;or
lack of news. She would be there waiting for me, I was sure, no
matter how prompt I might be, for though in ordinary circumstances,
after the first performance of a new play, either Maxine would have
gone out to supper, or invited guests to sup with her, she would
have accepted no invitation, given none, for to-night. She would
hurry out of the theatre, probably without waiting to remove her
stage make-up, and she would go home unaccompanied, except by her
maid.</p>
<p>Maxine lives in a charming little old-fashioned house, set back
in its own garden, a great "find" in a good quarter of Paris; and
her house could he reached in ten minutes' drive from my hotel. I
would not go as far as the gate, but would dismiss my cab at the
corner of the quiet street, as it would not he wise to advertise
the fact that Mademoiselle de Renzie was receiving a visit from a
young man at midnight. Fifteen minutes would give me plenty of time
for all this: therefore, at about a quarter to twelve I started to
go downstairs, and in the entrance hall almost ran against the last
person on earth I expected to see&mdash;Diana Forrest.</p>
<p>She was not alone, of course; but for a second or two I saw no
one else. There was none other except her precious and beautiful
face in the world; and for a wild instant I asked myself if she had
come here to see me, to take back all her cruel words of
misunderstanding, and to take me hack also. But it was only for an
instant&mdash;a very mad instant.</p>
<p>Then I realised that she couldn't have known I was to be at the
&Eacute;lys&eacute;e Palace Hotel, and that even if she had, she
would not have dreamed of coming to me. As common sense swept my
brain clear, I saw near the precious and beautiful face other
faces: Lady Mountstuart's, Lord Mountstuart's, Lisa Drummond's, and
Bob West's.</p>
<p>They were all in evening dress, the ladies in charming wraps
which appeared to consist mostly of lace and chiffon, and evidently
they had just come into the hotel from some place of amusement. The
beautiful face, which had been pale, grew rosy at sight of me,
though whether with amazement or anger, or both, I couldn't tell.
Lisa smiled, looking more impish even than usual; but it was plain
that the others, Lord Mountstuart among them, were surprised to see
me here.</p>
<p>"Goodness, is it you or your ghost?" exclaimed Lady Mountstuart,
in the soft accents of California, which have never changed in
spite of the long years of her married life in England.</p>
<p>If it had been my ghost it would have vanished immediately, to
save Di from embarrassment, and also to prevent any delay in
getting to Maxine's. But, unfortunately, a flesh and blood young
man must stop for conventional politeness before he can disappear,
no matter what presses.</p>
<p>I said "How do you do?" to everyone, adding that I was as
surprised to see them as they could be to see me. I even grinned
civilly at Lord Robert West, though finding him here with Di,
looking particularly pleased with himself, made me want to knock
him down.</p>
<p>"Oh, it was a plan, as far as Mounty and Lord Robert and I are
concerned," explained Lady Mountstuart. "Of course, Lord Robert
ought to have been at the Duchess's bazaar this afternoon, but then
he won't show up at such things, even to please his sister, and Di
and Lisa were to have represented me there. To-day and to-morrow
are the only days all three of us could possibly steal to get away
and look at a most wonderful motor car; made for a Rajah who died
before it was ready. Lord Robert certainly knows more about
automobiles than any other human being does, and he thought this
was just what I would want. Di had the most horrid headache this
morning, poor child, and wasn't fit for the fatigue of a big crush,
so, as she's a splendid sailor, I persuaded her to come with
us&mdash;and Lisa, too, of course. We caught the afternoon train to
Boulogne, and had such a glorious crossing that we actually all had
the courage to dress and dine at Madrid&mdash;wasn't it plucky of
us? But we're collapsing now, and have come back early, as we must
inspect the car the first thing to-morrow morning and do a heap of
shopping afterwards."</p>
<p>"If you're collapsing, I mustn't keep you standing here a
moment," I said, anxious for more than one reason to get away. Di
wasn't looking at me. Half turned from me, purposely I didn't
doubt, she had begun a conversation with Bob West, who beamed with
joy over her kindness to him and her apparent indifference to
me.</p>
<p>"'Collapsing' is an exaggeration perhaps," laughed Lady
Mountstuart. "But, instead of keeping us standing here, come up to
our sitting-room and have a little talk&mdash;and whisky and
soda."</p>
<p>"Yes, do come, Dundas," her husband added.</p>
<p>"Thank you both," I stammered, trying not to look embarrassed.
"But&mdash;I know you're all tired, and&mdash;."</p>
<p>"And perhaps you have some nice engagement," piped Lisa.</p>
<p>"It's too late for respectable British young men to have
engagements in naughty Paris," said Lady Mountstuart, laughing
again (she looks very handsome when she laughs, and knows it).
"Isn't that true, Mr. Dundas?"</p>
<p>"It depends upon the engagement," I managed to reply calmly. But
then, as Di suddenly turned and looked straight at me with marked
coldness, the blood sprang up to my face. I began to stammer again
like a young ass of a schoolboy. "I'm afraid that
I&mdash;er&mdash;the fact is, I <i>am</i> engaged. A matter of
business. I wish I could get out of it, but I can't,
and&mdash;er&mdash;I shall have to run off, or I will be late.
Good-bye,&mdash;good-bye." Then I mumbled something about hoping to
see them again before they left Paris, and escaped, knowing that I
had made a horrid mess of my excuses. Di was laughing at something
West said, as I turned away, and though perhaps his remark and her
laugh had nothing to do with me, my ears burned, and there was a
cold lump of iron, or something that felt like it, where my heart
ought to have been.</p>
<p>Now was Lord Robert's time to propose&mdash;now, when she
believed me faithless and unworthy&mdash;if he but knew it. And I
was afraid that he would know it.</p>
<p>I got out into the open air, feeling half-dazed as one of the
under porters called me a cab. I gave the name of a street in the
direction, but at some distance from Maxine's, lest ears should
hear which ought not to hear: and it was only when we were well
away from the hotel that I amended my first instructions. Even
then, I mentioned the street leading into the one where I was due,
not the street itself.</p>
<p>"<i>Dep&ecirc;chez vous</i>" I added, for I had delayed eight or
ten minutes longer than I ought, and this had upset the exactness
of my calculations. The man obeyed; nevertheless, instead of
reaching the top of Maxine's street at two or three minutes before
twelve, as I had intended, it was nearly ten minutes past when I
got out of my cab at the corner: and when I came to the gate of the
house a clock somewhere was striking the quarter hour after
midnight.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>MAXINE ACTS ON THE STAGE AND OFF</h3>
<p>How I got through the play on that awful night, I don't
know.</p>
<p>When I went onto the stage to take up my cue, soon after the
beginning of the first act, my brain was a blank. I could not
remember a single line that I had to say. I couldn't even see
through the dazzling mist which floated before my eyes, to
recognise Raoul in the box where I knew he would be sitting
unless&mdash;something had happened. But presently I was conscious
of one pair of hands clapping more than all the rest. Yes, Raoul
was there. I felt his love reaching out to me and warming my
chilled heart like a ray of sunshine that finds its way through
shadows. I must not fail. For his sake, I must not fail. I never
had failed, and I would not now&mdash;above all, not now.</p>
<p>It was the thought of Raoul that gave me back my courage; and
though I couldn't have said one word of my part before I came on
the stage to answer that first cue, by the time the applause had
died down enough to let me speak, each line seemed to spring into
my mind as it was needed. Then I got out of myself and into the
part, as I always do, but had feared not to do to-night. The
audience was mine, to play with as I liked, to make laugh, to make
cry, and clap its hands or shout "Brava-brava!"</p>
<p>Yet for once I feared it, feared that great crowd of people out
there, as a lion tamer must at some time or other fear one of his
lions. "What if they know all I've done?" The question flashed
across my brain. "What if a voice in the auditorium should suddenly
shout that Maxine de Renzie had betrayed France for money, English
money?" How these hands which applauded would tingle to seize me by
the throat and choke my life out.</p>
<p>Still, with these thoughts murmuring in my head like a kind of
dreadful undertone, I went on. An actress can always go
on&mdash;till she breaks. I think that she can't be bent, as other
women can: and I envy the women who haven't had to learn the lesson
of hardening themselves. It seems to me that they must suffer
less.</p>
<p>At last came the end of the first act. But there were five
curtain calls. Five times I had to go back and smile, and bow, and
look delighted with the ovation I was having. Then, when the time
came that I could escape, I met on the way to my dressing-room men
carrying big harps and crowns, baskets and bunches of flowers which
had been sent up to me on the stage. I pushed past, hardly glancing
at them, for I knew that Raoul would be waiting.</p>
<p>There he was, radiant with his unselfish pride in me&mdash;my
big, handsome lover, looking more like the Apollo Belvedere come
alive and dressed in modern clothes than like an ordinary
diplomatic young man from the Foreign Office. But then, of course,
he is really quite out of place in diplomacy. Since he can't exist
on a marble pedestal or some Old Master's canvas, he ought at least
to be a poet or an artist&mdash;and so he is at heart; not one, but
both; and a dreamer of beautiful dreams, as beautiful and noble as
his own clear-cut face, which might be cold if it were not for the
eyes, and lips.</p>
<p>There were people about, and we spoke like mere acquaintances
until I'd led Raoul into the little boudoir which adjoins my
dressing-room. Then&mdash;well, we spoke no longer like mere
acquaintances. That is enough to say. And we had five minutes
together, before I was obliged to send him away, and go to dress
for the second act.</p>
<p>The touch of Raoul's hands, and those lips of his that are not
cold, gave me strength to go through all that was yet to come.
There's something almost magical in the touch&mdash;just a little,
little touch&mdash;of the one we love best. For a moment we can
forget everything else, even if it were death itself waiting just
round the corner. I've flirted with more than one man, sometimes
because I liked him and it amused me,&mdash;as with Ivor
Dundas,&mdash;sometimes because I had to win him for politic
reasons. But I never knew that blessed feeling until I met Raoul du
Laurier. It was a heavenly rest now to lay my head for a minute on
his shoulder, just shutting my eyes, without speaking a word.</p>
<p>I thought&mdash;for I was worn out, body and soul, with the
strain of keeping up and hiding my secret&mdash;that when I was
dead the best paradise would be to lean so on Raoul's shoulder,
never moving, for the first two or three hundred years of eternity.
But as the peaceful fancy cooled my brain, back darted remembrance,
like a poisonous snake. I reminded myself how little I deserved
such a paradise, and how my lover's dear arms would put me away, in
a kind of unbelieving horror, if he knew what I had done, and how I
had betrayed his trust in me.</p>
<p>For ten years I'd been a political spy&mdash;yes. But I owed a
grudge to Russia, which I'd promised my father to pay: and France
is Russia's ally. Besides, it seems less vile to betray a country
than to deceive a man you adore, who adores you in return. We women
are true as truth itself to those we love. For them we would
sacrifice the greatest cause. Always I had known this, and I had
thought that I could prove myself truer than the truest, if I ever
loved. Yet now I had betrayed my lover and sold his country; and,
realising what I had done, as I hardly had realised it till this
moment, I suffered torture in his arms.</p>
<p>Even if, by something like a miracle, we were saved from ruin,
nothing on earth could wash the stain from my heart, which Raoul
believed so good, so pure.</p>
<p>What can be more terrible for a woman than the secret knowledge
that to hold a man's respect she must always keep one dark spot
covered from his eyes? Such a woman needs no future punishment. She
has all she deserves in this world. My punishment had begun, and it
would always go on through my life with Raoul, I knew, even if no
great disaster came. Into the heart of my happiness would come the
thought of that hidden spot; how often, oh, how often, would I feel
that thought stir like a black bat!</p>
<p>I could no longer rest with my eyes shut, at peace after the
storm. I shuddered and sobbed, though my lids were dry, and Raoul
tried to soothe me, thinking it was but my excitement in playing
for the first time a heavy and exacting part. He little guessed how
heavy and exacting it really was!</p>
<p>"Darling," he said, "you were wonderful. And how proud I was of
you&mdash;how proud I am. I thought it would be impossible to
worship you more than I did. But I love you a thousand times more
than ever to-night."</p>
<p>It was true, I knew. I could see it in his eyes, hear it in his
voice. Since his dreadful misfortune in losing the diamonds, since
I had comforted him for their loss, and insisted on giving him all
I had to help him out of his trouble, he had seen in me the angel
of his salvation. To-night his heart was almost breaking with love
for me, who so ill deserved it. Now, I had news for him, which
would make him long to shout for joy. If I chose, I could tell him
that the jewels were safe. He would love me still more passionately
in his happiness, which I had given, than in his grief; and I would
take all his love as if it were my right, hiding the secret of my
treachery as long as I could. But how long would that be? How could
I be sure that the theft of the treaty had not already been
discovered, and that the avalanche of ruin was not on its way to
blot us for ever out of life and love?</p>
<p>The fear made me nestle nearer to him, and cling tightly,
because I said to myself that perhaps I might never be in his arms
again: that this might be the last time that his eyes&mdash;those
eyes that are not cold&mdash;might look at me with love in them, as
now.</p>
<p>"Suppose all these people out there had hated and hissed me,
instead of applauding?" I asked. "Would you still be proud of me,
still care for me?"</p>
<p>"I'd love you better, if there could be a 'better,'" he
answered, holding me very close.</p>
<p>"You know, dearest one, most beautiful one, that I'm a jealous
brute. I can't bear you to belong to others&mdash;even to the
public that appreciates you almost as much as you deserve to be
appreciated. Of course I'm proud that they adore you, but I'd like
to take you away from them and adore you all by myself. Why, if the
whole world turned against you, there'd be a kind of joy in that
for me. I'd be so glad of the chance to face it for you, to shield
you from it always."</p>
<p>"Then, what <i>is</i> there would make you love me less?" I went
on, dwelling on the subject with a dreadful fascination, as one
looks over the brink of a precipice.</p>
<p>"Nothing on God's earth&mdash;while you kept true to me."</p>
<p>"And if I weren't true&mdash;if I deceived you?"</p>
<p>"Why, I'd kill you&mdash;and myself after. But it makes me see
red&mdash;a blazing scarlet&mdash;even to think of such a thing.
Why should you speak of it&mdash;when it's beyond possibility,
thank Heaven! I know you love me, or you wouldn't make such noble
sacrifices to save me from ruin."</p>
<p>I shivered: and I shall not be colder when they lay me in my
coffin. I wished that I had not looked over that precipice, down
into blackness. Why dwell on horrors, when I might have five
minutes of happiness&mdash;perhaps the last I should ever know? I
remembered the piece of good news I had for Raoul. I would have
told him then, but he went on, saying to me so many things sweet
and blessed to hear, that I could not bear to cut him short, lest
never after this should he speak words of love to me.
Then&mdash;long before it ought, so it seemed&mdash;the clock in
mydressing-room struck, and I knew that I hadn't another instant to
spare. On some first nights I might have been willing to risk
keeping the curtain down (though I am rather conscientious in such
ways), but to-night I wanted, more than anything else, to have the
play over, and to get home by midnight or before, so that my
suspense might be ended, and I might know the worst&mdash;or
best.</p>
<p>"I must go. You must leave me, dear," I said. "But I've some
good news for you when there's time to explain, and a great
surprise. I can't give you a minute until the last, for you know
I've almost to open the third and fourth acts. But when the curtain
goes down on my death scene, come behind again. I shan't take any
calls&mdash;after dying, it's too inartistic, isn't it? And I never
do. I'll see you for just a few more minutes here, in this room,
before I dress to go home."</p>
<p>"For a few minutes!" Raoul caught me up. "But afterwards? You
promised me long ago that I should have supper with you at your
house&mdash;just you and I alone together&mdash;on the first night
of the new play."</p>
<p>My heart gave a jump as he reminded me of this promise. Never
before had I forgotten an engagement with Raoul. But this time I
had forgotten. There had been so many miserable things to think of,
that they had crowded the one pleasant thing out of my tortured
brain. I drew away from him involuntarily with a start of
surprise.</p>
<p>"You'd forgotten!" exclaimed Raoul, disappointed and hurt.</p>
<p>"Only for the instant," I said, "because I'm hardly myself. I'm
tired and excited, unstrung, as I always am on first nights.
But&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Would you rather not be bothered with me?" he asked wistfully,
as I paused to think what I should do.</p>
<p>His eyes looked as if the light had suddenly gone out of them,
and I couldn't bear that. It might too soon be struck out for ever,
and by me.</p>
<p>"Don't say 'bothered'!" I reproached him. "That's a cruel word.
The question is&mdash;I'm worn out. I don't think I shall be able
to eat supper. My maid will want to put me to bed, the minute I get
home. Poor old Marianne! She's such a tyrant, when she fancies it's
for my good. It, generally ends in my obeying her&mdash;seldom in
her obeying me. But we'll see how I feel when the last act's over.
We'll talk of it when you come here&mdash;after my death." I tried
to laugh, as I made that wretched jest, but I was sorry when I made
it, and my laugh didn't ring true. There was a shadow on Raoul's
face&mdash;that dear, sensitive face of his which shows too much
feeling for a man in this work-a-day, strenuous world&mdash;but I
had little time to comfort him.</p>
<p>"It will be like coming to life again, to see you," I said. "And
now, good-bye! no, not good-bye, but <i>au revoir</i>."</p>
<p>I sent him away, and flew into my dressing-room next door, where
Marianne was growing very nervous, and aimlessly shifting my
make-up things on the dressing table, or fussing with some part of
my dress for the next act.</p>
<p>"There's a letter for you, Mademoiselle," said she. "The
stage-door keeper just brought it round. But you haven't time to
read it now."</p>
<p>A wave of faintness swept over me. Supposing Ivor had had bad
news, and thought it best to warn me without delay?</p>
<p>"I must read the letter," I insisted. "Give it to me at
once."</p>
<p>Occasionally Marianne (who has been with me for many years, and
is old enough to be my mother) argues a matter on which we
disagree: but something in my voice, I suppose, made her obey me
with extraordinary promptness. Then came a shock&mdash;and not of
relief. I recognised on the envelope the handwriting of Count
Godensky.</p>
<p>I know that I am not a coward. Yet it was only by the strongest
effort of will that I forced myself to open that letter. I was
afraid&mdash;afraid of a hundred things. But most of all, I was
afraid of learning that the treaty was in his hands. It would be
like him to tell me he had it, and try to drive some dreadful
bargain.</p>
<p>Nerving myself, as I suppose a condemned criminal must nerve
himself to go to the guillotine or the gallows, I opened the
letter. For as long as I might have counted "one, two," slowly, the
paper looked black before my eyes, as if ink were spilt over it,
blotting out the words: but the dark smudge cleared away, and
showed me&mdash;nothing, except that, if Alexis Godensky held a
trump card, I was not to have a sight of it until later, when he
chose.</p>
<blockquote class="note">
 <P>"MY DEAR MAXINE," [he began his letter, though he had never been
    given the right to call me Maxine, and never had dared so to
    call me before] "I must see you, and talk to you this evening,
    alone. This for your own sake and that of another, even more
    than mine, though you know very well what it is to me to be with
    you. Perhaps you may be able to guess that this is important. I
    am so sure that you <i>will</i> guess, and that you will not only be
    willing but anxious to see me to-night, if you never were
    before, that I shall venture to be waiting for you at the stage
    door when you come out.</p>
 <p>"Yours, in whatever way you will,</P>
    <p>"ALEXIS."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If anything could have given me pleasure at that moment, it
would have been to tear the letter in little pieces, with the
writer looking on. Then to throw those pieces in his hateful face,
and say, "That's your answer."</p>
<p>But he was not looking on, and even if he had been I could not
have done what I wished. He knew that I would have to consent to
see him, that he need have no fear I would profit by my knowledge
of his intentions, to order him sent away from the stage door. I
would have to see him. But how could I manage it after
refusing&mdash;as I must refuse&mdash;to let Raoul go home with me?
Raoul was coming to me after my death scene on the stage. At the
very least, he would expect to put me into my carriage when I left
the theatre, even if he went no further. Yet there would be
Godensky, waiting, and Raoul would see him. What could I do to
escape from such an <i>impasse</i>?</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>MAXINE GIVES BACK THE DIAMONDS</h3>
<p>I tried to answer the question, to decide something; but my
brain felt dead. "I can't think now. I must trust to
luck&mdash;trust to luck," I said to myself, desperately, as
Marianne dressed me. "By and by I'll think it all out."</p>
<p>But after that my part gave me no more time to think. I was not
Maxine de Renzie, but Princess H&eacute;l&egrave;ne of Hungaria,
whose tragic fate was even more sure and swift than miserable
Maxine's. When Princess H&eacute;l&egrave;ne had died in her
lover's arms, however (died as Maxine had not deserved to die), and
I was able to pick up the tangled threads of my own life, where I'd
laid them down, the questions were still crying out for answer, and
must somehow be decided at once.</p>
<p>First, there was Raoul to be put off and got out of the
way&mdash;Raoul, my best beloved, whose help and protection I
needed so much, yet must forego, and hurt him instead.</p>
<p>The stage-door keeper had orders to let him "come behind," and
so he was already waiting at the door of my little boudoir by the
time H&eacute;l&egrave;ne had died, the curtain had gone down, and
Maxine de Renzie had been able to leave the stage.</p>
<p>As we went together into the room, he caught both my hands,
crushing them tightly in his, and kissing them over and over again.
But his face was pale and sad, and a new fear sprang up in my
heart, like a sudden live flame among red ashes.</p>
<p>"What is it, Raoul?&mdash;why do you look like that?" I asked;
while inside my head another question sounded like a shriek. "What
if some word had come to him in the theatre&mdash;about the
treaty?"</p>
<p>Then I could have cried as a child cries, with the snapping of
the tension, when he answered: "It was only that terrible last
scene, darling. I've seen you die in other parts. But it never
affected me like this. Perhaps it's because you didn't belong to me
in those days. Or is it that you were more realistic in your acting
to-night than ever before? Anyway, it was awful&mdash;so horribly
real. It was all I could do to sit still and not jump out of the
box to save you. Prince Cyril was a poor chap not to thwart the
villain. I should have killed him in the third act, and then
H&eacute;l&egrave;ne might have been happily married, instead of
dying."</p>
<p>"I believe you would have killed him," I said.</p>
<p>"I know I should. It's a mistake not to be jealous. I admit that
I'm jealous. But such jealousy is a compliment to a woman, my
dearest, not an insult."</p>
<p>"How you feel things!" I exclaimed. "Even a play on the
stage&mdash;"</p>
<p>"If the woman I love is the heroine."</p>
<p>"Will you ever be blas&eacute;, like the rest of the men I
know?" I laughed, though I could have sobbed.</p>
<p>"Never, I think. It isn't in me. Do you despise me for my
enthusiasm?"</p>
<p>"I only love you the more," I said, wondering every instant, in
a kind of horrid undertone, how I was to get him away.</p>
<p>"I admit I wasn't made for diplomacy," he went on. "I wish, I
had money enough to get out of it and take you off the stage, away
into some beautiful, peaceful world, where we need think of nothing
but our love for each other, and the good we might do others
because of our love, and to keep our world beautiful. Would you go
with me?"</p>
<p>"Ah, if I could!" I sighed. "If I could go with you to-morrow,
away into that beautiful, peaceful world. But-who knows?
Meanwhile&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Meanwhile, you don't mean to send me away from you?" he
pleaded, in a coaxing way he has, which is part of his charm, and
makes him seem like a boy. "You don't know what it is, after that
scene of your death on the stage, where I couldn't get to
you&mdash;where another man was your lover&mdash;to touch you
again, alive and warm, your own adorable, vivid self. You
<i>will</i> let me go home with you, in your carriage, anyhow as
far as the house, and kiss you good-night there, even if you're so
tired you must drive me out then?"</p>
<p>I would have given all my success of that night, and more, to
say "yes." But instead I had to stumble into excuses. I had to
argue that we mustn't be seen leaving the theatre
together&mdash;yet, until everyone knew that we were engaged. As
for letting him come to me at home, if he dreamt how my head ached,
he wouldn't ask it. I almost broke down as I said this; and poor
Raoul was so sorry for me that he immediately offered to leave me
at once.</p>
<p>"It's a great sacrifice, though, to give up what I've been
looking forward to for days," he said, "and to let you go from me
to-night of all nights."</p>
<p>"Why to-night of all nights?", I asked quickly, my coward
conscience frightening me again.</p>
<p>"Only because I love you more than ever, and&mdash;it's a stupid
feeling, of course, I suppose all the fault of that last scene in
the play&mdash;yet I feel as if&mdash;But no, I don't want to say
it."</p>
<p>"You must say it," I cried.</p>
<p>"Well, if only to hear you contradict me, then. I feel as if I
were in danger of losing you. It's just a feeling&mdash;a weight on
my heart. Nothing more. Rather womanish, isn't it?"</p>
<p>"Not womanish, but foolish," I said. "Shake off the feeling, as
one wakes up from a nightmare. Think of to-morrow. Meeting then
will be all the sweeter." As I spoke, it was as if a voice echoed
mine, saying different words mockingly. "If there be any
meeting&mdash;to-morrow, or ever."</p>
<p>I shut my ears to the voice, and went on quickly:</p>
<p>"Before we say good-bye, I've something to show
you&mdash;something you'll like very much. Wait here till I get it
from the next room."</p>
<p>Marianne was tidying my dressing-room for the night, bustling
here and there, a dear old, comfortable, dependable thing. She was
delighted with my success, which she knew all about, of course; but
she was not in the least excited, because she had loyally expected
me to succeed, and would have thought the sky must be about to fall
if I had failed. She was as placid as she was on other, less
important nights, far more placid than she would have been if she
had known that she was guarding not only my jewellery, but a famous
diamond necklace, worth at least five hundred thousand francs.</p>
<p>There it was, under the lowest tray of my jewel box. I had felt
perfectly safe in leaving it there, for I knew that nothing on
earth&mdash;short of a bomb explosion&mdash;could tempt the good
creature out of my dressing-room in my absence, and that even if a
bomb did explode, she would try to be blown up with my jewel box
clutched in her hands.</p>
<p>Saying nothing to Marianne, who was brushing a little stage dust
off my third act dress, with my back to her I took out tray after
tray from the box (which always came with us to the theatre and
went away again in my carriage) until the electric light over the
dressing table set the diamonds on fire.</p>
<p>Really, I said to myself, they were wonderful stones. I had no
idea how magnificent they were. Not that there were a great many of
them. The necklace was composed of a single row of diamonds, with
six flat tassels depending from it. But the smallest stones at the
back, where the clasp came, were as large as my little finger nail,
and the largest were almost the size of a filbert. All were of
perfect colour and fire, extraordinarily deep and faultlessly
shaped, as well as flawless. Besides, the necklace had a history
which would have made it interesting even if it hadn't been
intrinsically of half its value.</p>
<p>With the first thrill of pleasure I had felt since I knew that
the treaty had disappeared I lifted the beautiful diamonds from the
box, and slipped them into a small embroidered bag of pink and
silver brocade which lay on the table. It was a foolish but pretty
little bag, which a friend had made and sent to me at the theatre a
few nights ago, and was intended to carry a purse and handkerchief.
But I had never used it yet. Now it seemed a convenient receptacle
for the necklace, and I suddenly planned out my way of giving it to
Raoul.</p>
<p>At first, earlier in the evening, I had meant to put the
diamonds in his hands and say, "See what I have for you!" But now I
had changed my mind, because he must be induced to go away as
quickly as possible&mdash;quite, quite away from the theatre, so
that there would be no danger of his seeing Count Godensky at the
stage door. I was not sorry that Raoul was jealous, because, as he
said, his jealousy was a compliment to me; and it is possible only
for a cold man never to be jealous of a woman in my profession, who
lives in the eyes of the world. But I did not want him to be
jealous of the Russian; and he would be horribly jealous, if he
thought that he had the least cause.</p>
<p>If I showed him the diamonds now, he would want to stop and
talk. He would ask me questions which I would rather not answer
until I'd seen Ivor Dundas again, and knew better what to
say&mdash;whether truth or fiction. Still, I wished Raoul to have
the necklace to-night, because it would mean all the difference to
him between constant, gnawing anxiety, and the joy of deliverance.
Let him have a happy night, even though I was sending him away,
even though I did not know what to-morrow might bring, either for
him or for me.</p>
<p>I tied the gold cords of the bag in two hard knots, and went out
with it to Raoul in the next room.</p>
<p>"This holds something precious," I said, smiling at him, and
making a mystery. "You'll value the something, I know&mdash;partly
for itself, partly because I&mdash;because I've been at a lot of
trouble to get it for you. When you see it, you'll be more resigned
not to see me&mdash;just for tonight. But you're to write me a
letter, please, and describe accurately every one of your
sensations on opening the bag. Also, you may say in your letter a
few kind things about me, if you like. And I want it to come to me
when I first wake up to-morrow morning. So go now, dearest, and
have the sensations, and write about them. I shall be thinking of
you every minute, asleep or awake."</p>
<p>"Why mayn't I look now?" asked Raoul, taking the soft mass of
pink and silver from me, in the nice, clumsy way a big man has of
handling a woman's things.</p>
<p>"Because&mdash;just <i>because</i>. But perhaps you'll guess
why, by and by," I said. Then I held up my face to be kissed, and
he bundled the small bag away in an inside pocket of his coat, as
carelessly as if it held nothing but a handkerchief and a pair of
gloves.</p>
<p>"Be careful!" I couldn't help exclaiming. But I don't think he
heard, for he had me in his arms and was kissing me as if he knew
the fear in my heart&mdash;the fear that it might be for the last
time.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>MAXINE DRIVES WITH THE ENEMY</h3>
<p>When Raoul was gone I made Marianne hurry me out of the
cloth-of-gold and filmy tissue in which the unfortunate Princess
H&eacute;l&egrave;ne had died, and into the black gown in which the
almost equally unfortunate Maxine had come to the theatre. I did
not even stop to take off my make-up, for though the play was an
unusually short one, and all the actors and actresses had followed
my example of prompt readiness for all four acts, it lacked twenty
minutes of twelve when I was dressed. I had to see Count Godensky,
get rid of him somehow, and still be in time to keep my appointment
with Ivor Dundas, for which I knew he would strain every nerve not
to be late.</p>
<p>My electric carriage would be at the stage door, and my plan was
to speak to Godensky, if he were waiting, if possible learn in a
moment or two whether he had really found out the truth, and then
act accordingly. But if I could avoid it, I meant, in any case, to
put off a long conversation until later.</p>
<p>I had drawn my veil down before walking out of the theatre, yet
Godensky knew me at once, and came forward. Evidently he had been
watching the door.</p>
<p>"Good-evening," he said. "A hundred congratulations."</p>
<p>He put out his hand, and I had to give him mine, for my
chauffeur and the stage-door keeper (to say nothing of Marianne,
who followed me closely), and several stage-carpenters, with other
employ&eacute;s of the theatre, were within seeing and hearing
distance. I wanted no gossip, though that was exactly what might
best please Count Godensky.</p>
<p>"I got your note," I answered, in Russian, though he had spoken
in French. "What is it you want to see me about?"</p>
<p>"Something that can't be told in a moment," he said. "Something
of great importance."</p>
<p>"I'm very tired," I sighed. "Can't it wait until to-morrow?"</p>
<p>I tried to "draw" him, and to a certain extent, I succeeded.</p>
<p>"You wouldn't ask that question, if you guessed what&mdash;I
know," he replied.</p>
<p>Was it a bluff, or did he know&mdash;not merely
suspect&mdash;something?</p>
<p>"I don't understand you," I said quietly, though my lips were
dry.</p>
<p>"Shall I mention the word&mdash;<i>document?</i>" he hinted.
"Really, I'm sure you won't regret it if you let me drive home with
you, Mademoiselle."</p>
<p>"I can't do that," I answered. "And I can't take you into my
carriage here. But I'll stop for you, and wait at the corner Rue
Eug&egrave;ne Beauharnais. Then you can go with me until I think it
best for you to get out."</p>
<p>"Very well," he agreed. "But send your maid home in a cab; I can
not talk before her."</p>
<p>"Yes, you can. She knows no language except French&mdash;and a
little English. She always drives home with me."</p>
<p>This was true. But if I had been talking to Raoul, I would
perhaps have given the dear old woman her first experience of being
sent off by herself. In that case, she would not have minded, for
she likes Raoul, admires him as a "dream of a young man," and
already suspected what I hadn't yet told her&mdash;that we were
engaged. But with Count Godensky forced upon me as a companion, I
would not for any consideration have parted with Marianne.</p>
<p>Three or four minutes after starting I was giving instructions
to my chauffeur where to stop, and almost immediately afterwards
Godensky appeared. He got in and took the place at my left,
Marianne, silent, but doubtless astonished, facing us on the little
front seat.</p>
<p>"Now," I exclaimed. "Please begin quickly."</p>
<p>"Don't force me to be too abrupt," he said. "I would spare you
if I could. You speak as if you grudged me every moment with you.
Yet I am here because I love you."</p>
<p>"Oh, please, Monsieur!" I broke in. "You know I've told you that
is useless."</p>
<p>"But everything is changed since then. Perhaps now, even your
mind will be changed. That happens with women sometimes. I want to
warn you of a great danger that threatens you, Maxine. Perhaps,
late as it is, I could save you from it if you'd let me."</p>
<p>"Save me from what?" I asked temporising. "You're very
mysterious, Count Godensky. And I'm Mademoiselle de Renzie except
to my very intimate friends."</p>
<p>"I am your friend, always. Maybe you will even permit me to
speak of myself as your 'intimate friend' when I have done what I
hope to do for you in&mdash;in the matter of a certain document
which has disappeared."</p>
<p>I was quivering all over. But I had not lost hope yet; I think
that some women, feeling as I did, would have fainted. But it would
have been better for me to die and be out of my troubles for ever,
than to let myself faint and show Godensky that he had struck
home.</p>
<p>"Be quiet. Be cool. Be brave now, if never again," I said to
myself. And my voice sounded perfectly natural as I exclaimed: "Oh,
the 'document' again. The one you spoke about when we first met
to-night. You rouse my curiosity. But I don't in the least know
what you mean."</p>
<p>"The loss of it is known," he said.</p>
<p>"Ah, it's a lost document?"</p>
<p>"As you will be lost, Maxine, if you don't come to me for the
help I'm only too glad to give&mdash;on conditions. Let me tell you
what they are."</p>
<p>"Wouldn't it be more to the point if you told me what the
document is, and how it concerns me?" I parried him, determined to
bring him to bay.</p>
<p>"Aren't <i>you</i> evading the point far more than I? The
document&mdash;which you and I can both see as plainly before our
eyes at this instant as though it were in&mdash;let us say your
hands, or&mdash;du Laurier's, if he were here&mdash;that document
is far too important even to name within hearing of other
ears."</p>
<p>"Marianne's? But I told you she can't understand a word of
Russian."</p>
<p>"One can't be sure. We can never tell, in these days, who may
not be&mdash;a spy."</p>
<p>There was a stab for me! But I would not give him the
satisfaction of showing that it hurt. He wanted to confuse me, to
put me off my guard; but he should not.</p>
<p>"They say one judges others by one's self," I laughed. "Count
Godensky, if you throw out such lurid hints about my poor, fat
Marianne, I shall begin to wonder if it's not <i>you</i> who are
the spy!"</p>
<p>"Since you trust your woman so implicitly, then," he went on,
"I'll tell you what you want to know. The document I speak of is
the one you took out of the Foreign Office the other day, when you
called on your&mdash;friend, Monsieur le Vicomte du Laurier."</p>
<p>"Dear me!" I exclaimed. "You say you want to be my friend, yet
you seem to think I am a kleptomaniac. I can't imagine what I
should want with any dry old document out of the Foreign Office,
can you?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I can imagine," said Godensky drily.</p>
<p>"Pray tell me then. Also what document it was. For, joking
apart, this is rather a serious accusation."</p>
<p>"If I make any accusation, it's less against you than du
Laurier."</p>
<p>"Oh, you make an accusation against him. Why do you make it to
me?"</p>
<p>"As a warning."</p>
<p>"Or because you don't dare make it to anyone else."</p>
<p>"Dare! I haven't accused him thus far, because to do so would
brand your name with his."</p>
<p>"Ah!" I said. "You are very considerate."</p>
<p>"I don't pretend to be considerate&mdash;except of myself. I've
waited, and held my hand until now, because I wanted to see you
before doing a thing which would mean certain ruin for du Laurier.
I love you as much as I ever did; even more, because, in common
with most men, I value what I find hard to get. To-night I ask you
again to marry me. Give me a different answer from that you gave me
before, and I'll be silent about what I know."</p>
<p>"What you know of the document you mentioned?" I asked, my heart
drumming an echo of its beating in my ears.</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"But&mdash;I thought you said that its loss was already
discovered?" (Oh, I was keeping myself well under control, though a
mistake now would surely cost me more than I dared count!)</p>
<p>For half a second he was taken aback, at a loss what answer to
make. Half a second&mdash;no more; yet that hardly perceptible
hesitation told me what I had been playing with him to find
out.</p>
<p>"Discovered by me," he explained. "That is, by me and one person
over whom I have such an influence that he will use his knowledge,
or&mdash;forget it, according to my advice."</p>
<p>"There is no such person," I said to myself. But I didn't say it
aloud. Quickly I named over in my mind such men in the French
Foreign Office as were in a position to discover the disappearance
of any document under Raoul du Laurier's charge. There were several
who might have done so, some above Raoul in authority, some below;
but I was certain that not one of them was an intimate friend of
Count Godensky's. If he had suspected anything the day he met me
coming out of the Foreign Office he might, of course, have hinted
his suspicions to one of those men (though all along I'd believed
him too shrewd to risk the consequences, the ridicule and
humiliation of a mistake): but if he had spoken, it would be beyond
his power to prevent matters from taking their own course,
independent of my decisions and his actions.</p>
<p>I believed now that what I had hoped was true. He was
"bluffing." He wanted me to flounder into some admission, and to
make him a promise in order to save the man I loved. I was only a
woman, he'd argued, no doubt&mdash;an emotional woman, already
wrought up to a high pitch of nervous excitement. Perhaps he had
expected to have easy work with me. And I don't think that my
silence after his last words discouraged him. He imagined me
writhing at the alternative of giving up Raoul or seeing him
ruined, and he believed that he knew me well enough to be sure what
I would do in the end.</p>
<p>"Well?" he said at last, quite gently.</p>
<p>My eyes had been bent on my lap, but I glanced suddenly up at
him, and saw his face in the light of the street lamps as we
passed. Count Godensky is not more Mephistophelian in type than any
other dark, thin man with a hook nose, keen eyes, heavy browed; a
prominent chin and a sharply waxed, military moustache trained to
point upward slightly at the ends. But to my fancy he looked
absolutely devilish at that moment. Still, I was less afraid of him
than I had been since the day I stole the treaty.</p>
<p>"Well," I said slowly, "I think it's time that you left me
now."</p>
<p>"That's your answer? You can't mean it."</p>
<p>"I do mean it, just as much as I meant to refuse you the three
other times that you did me the same honour. You asked me to hear
what you had to say to-night, and I have heard it; so there's no
reason why I shouldn't press the electric bell for my chauffeur to
stop, and&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Do you know that you're pronouncing du Laurier's doom, to say
nothing of your own?"</p>
<p>"No. I don't know it."</p>
<p>"Then I haven't made myself clear enough."</p>
<p>"That's true. You haven't made yourself clear enough."</p>
<p>"In what detail have I failed? Because&mdash;".</p>
<p>"In the detail of the document. I've told you I know nothing
about it. You've told me you know everything. Yet&mdash;"</p>
<p>"So I do."</p>
<p>"Prove that by saying what it is&mdash;to satisfy my
curiosity."</p>
<p>"I've explained why I can't do that&mdash;here."</p>
<p>"Then why should you stay here longer, since that is the point,
to my mind. You understood before you came into my carriage that I
had no intention of letting you go all the way home with me."</p>
<p>Count Godensky suddenly laughed. And the laugh frightened
me&mdash;frightened me horribly, just as I had begun to have
confidence in myself, and feel that I had got the best of the
game.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>MAXINE OPENS THE GATE FOR A MAN</h3>
<p>"You are afraid that du Laurier may find out," he said. "But he
knows already."</p>
<p>"Knows what?"</p>
<p>"That I expected to have the privilege of going to your house
with you."</p>
<p>All that I had gained seemed worthless. Those quiet, sneering
words of his almost crushed me. On the load I had struggled to bear
without falling they laid one feather too much.</p>
<p>My voice broke. "You&mdash;devil!" I cried at him. "You dared to
tell Raoul that?"</p>
<p>Opposite, on her narrow little seat, Marianne stirred uneasily.
Till now our tones had been quiet, and she could not understand one
word we said. She is the soul of discretion and a triumph of good
training in her walk of life; but she loves me more than she loves
any other creature on earth, and now she could see and hear that
the man had driven me to the brink of hysterics. She would have
liked to tear his face with her nails, or choke him, I think. If I
had given her the word, I believe she would have tried with all her
strength&mdash;which is not small&mdash;and a very good will, to
kill him. I was dimly conscious of what her restlessness meant, and
vaguely comforted too, by the thought of her supreme loyalty. But I
forgot Marianne when Godensky answered my question.</p>
<p>"Yes, I told him. It was the truth. And I've always understood
that you made a great point of never doing anything which you
considered in the least risqu&eacute;. So why should I suppose you
would rather du Laurier didn't know? You might already have
mentioned it to him."</p>
<p>"He wouldn't believe you!" I exclaimed, desperately. And my only
hope was that I might be right.</p>
<p>"As a matter of fact, he didn't seem to at first, so I at once
understood that you hadn't spoken of our appointment. But it was
too late to atone for my carelessness, and I did the next best
thing: justified my veracity. I suggested that, if he didn't take
my word for it, he might stand where he could see us speaking
together at the stage door, and&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Ah, I am glad of that!" I cut in. "Then he saw that we didn't
drive away together."</p>
<p>"You jump at conclusions, just like less clever women. I hardly
thought you'd receive me into your carriage at the theatre, so I
took the precaution of warning du Laurier that he needn't expect to
see that. You would suggest a place for me to meet you, I said.
When I knew it, I would inform him if he chose to wait about
somewhere for a few minutes."</p>
<p>"Raoul du Laurier would scorn to spy upon me!" I broke out.</p>
<p>"How hard you are on spies. And how little knowledge of human
nature you have, after all, if you don't understand that a man
suddenly out of his head with jealousy will do things of which he'd
be incapable when he was sane."</p>
<p>The argument silenced me. I knew&mdash;I had known for a long
time&mdash;that jealousy could rouse a demon in Raoul. And only
to-night he had reminded me that he was a "jealous brute." I
remembered what answer he had made when I asked him what he would
do if I deceived him. He said that he would kill me, and kill
himself after. As he spoke, the blood had streamed up to his
forehead, and streamed back again, leaving him pale. A flash like
steel had shot out of his eyes&mdash;the dear eyes that are not
cold. It was true, as this cruel wretch reminded me, Raoul would do
things under the torture of jealousy that he would cut off his hand
sooner than do when his own, sweet, poet-nature was in
ascendancy.</p>
<p>"As a proof of what I say," Godensky went on, "du Laurier did
wait, did hear from me the place where you were to stop and pick me
up. And if it wouldn't be the worst of form to bet, I'd bet that he
found some way of getting there in time to see that I had told the
truth."</p>
<p>"You coward!" I stammered.</p>
<p>"On the contrary, a brave man. I've heard that du Laurier is a
fine shot, and that very few men in Paris can touch him with the
foils. So you see&mdash;"</p>
<p>"You want to frighten me!" I exclaimed.</p>
<p>"You misjudge me in every way."</p>
<p>My only answer was to tell Marianne to press the button which
gives the signal for my chauffeur to stop. Instantly the electric
carriage slowed down, then came to a standstill. My man opened the
door and Count Godensky submitted to my will. Nevertheless, he was
far from being in a submissive mood, as I did not need to be
reminded by the tone of his voice when he said "au revoir."</p>
<p>Nothing could have been more polite than the words or his way of
speaking them, as he stood in the street with his hat in his hand.
But to me they meant a threat, and as a threat they were
intended.</p>
<p>My talk with Godensky at the stage door, my pause to pick him
up, and my second pause to set him down, had all taken time, of
which I had had little enough at the starting, if I were to meet
Ivor Dundas when he arrived. It was two or three minutes after
midnight, or so my watch said, when we drew up before the gate of
my high-walled garden in the quiet Rue d'Hollande.</p>
<p>A little while ago I had been ready to seize upon almost any
expedient for keeping Raoul away from my house to-night, but now,
after what I had just heard from Godensky, I prayed to see him
waiting for me.</p>
<p>Nobody (except Ivor, concerning whom I'd given orders) would be
let in so late at night, during my absence, not even Raoul himself;
so if he had come to reproach me, or break with me, he would have
to stand outside the locked gate till I appeared. I looked for him
longingly, but he was not there. There was, to be sure, a motor
brougham in the street, for a wonder (usually the Rue d'Hollande is
as empty as a desert, after eleven o'clock), but a girl's face
peered out at me from the window&mdash;an impish, curiously
abnormal little face it was&mdash;extinguishing the spark of hope
that sprang to life as I caught sight of the carriage.</p>
<p>It was standing before the closed gate of a house almost
opposite mine, and the girl seemed somewhat interested in me; but I
was not at all interested in her, and I hate being stared at as if
I were something in a museum.</p>
<p>The gate is always kept locked at night, when I'm at the
theatre; but Marianne has the key, and we let ourselves in when we
come, for only old Henri sits up, and he is growing a little deaf.
A moment, and we were inside, the chauffeur spinning away to the
garage.</p>
<p>Usually I am newly delighted every night with my quaint old
house and its small, but pretty garden, to which it seems
delightful to come home after hours of hard work at the theatre.
But to-night, though a cheerful light shone out from between the
drawn curtains of the salon, the place looked inexpressibly dreary,
even forbidding, to me. I felt that I hated the house, though I had
chosen it after a long search for peacefulness and privacy. How
gloomy, how dead, was the street beyond the high wall, with all its
windows closed like the eyes of corpses. There was a moist,
depressing smell of earth after long-continued rains, in the
garden. No wonder the place had been to let at a bargain, for a
long term! There had been a murder in it once, and it had stood
empty for twelve or thirteen of the fifteen years since the almost
forgotten tragedy. I had been the tenant for two years
now&mdash;before I became a "star," with a theatre of my own in
Paris. I had had no fear of the ghost said to haunt the house.
Indeed, I remembered thinking, and saying, that the story only made
the place more interesting. But now I said to myself that I wished
I had never spoken so lightly. Perhaps the ghost had brought me bad
luck. I felt as if the murder must have happened on just such a
still, brooding, damp night as this. Maybe it was the anniversary,
if I only knew.</p>
<p>I went indoors, Marianne following. Henri, very thin, very
precise, withered like a winter apple, had fallen into a doze in
the hall, where he had sat, hoping to hear the stopping of my
carriage. He rose up, bowing and blinking, just as he had done
often before, and would often again&mdash;if life were to go on for
me in the old way. He regretted not having heard Mademoiselle.
Would Mademoiselle take supper?</p>
<p>No, Mademoiselle would not take supper. She wanted nothing, and
Henri might go to bed.</p>
<p>"I thank Mademoiselle. When I have closed the house."</p>
<p>"But I don't want the house closed," I said. "I shall sit up for
awhile. It's hot&mdash;close and stuffy. I may like to have the
windows open."</p>
<p>"The visitor Mademoiselle expected did not arrive.
Perhaps&mdash;"</p>
<p>"If he comes, Marianne or I will let him in. But he may not
come, now it is so late."</p>
<p>When Henri had gone, I told Marianne that she might go, too. I
did not want her to wait. If the person I had expected should call,
it was a very old friend; in fact, Mr. Ivor Dundas, whom Marianne
must remember in London. He was to call&mdash;if he did
call&mdash;only on a matter of business, which would take but a few
minutes to get through, and possibly he would not even come into
the house. If the gate-bell rang, I would answer it myself, and
speak with Mr. Dundas, perhaps in the garden. Then I would let him
out and come straight upstairs. Marianne might go to bed if she
wished.</p>
<p>"I do not wish, unless Mademoiselle particularly desires me to
do so," said she. "I do not rest well when I have not been allowed
to undress Mademoiselle."</p>
<p>"Sit up, then, in your own room, and wait there for me till I
ring for you," I replied. "I shan't be late, whether Mr. Dundas
comes or doesn't come."</p>
<p>"Supposing the gate-bell should ring, and Mademoiselle should
go, yet it should not be the Monsieur she expects, but another
person whom she would not care to admit?"</p>
<p>I knew of what she was thinking, and of whom.</p>
<p>"There's no fear of that. No fear of any kind," I answered.</p>
<p>She took off my cloak, and went upstairs reluctantly, carrying
my jewel box.</p>
<p>I walked into the drawing-room, which was lighted and looked
very bright and charming, with its many flowers and framed
photographs, and the delightful Louis Quinze furniture, which I had
so enjoyed picking up here and there at antique shops or at private
sales.</p>
<p>I flung myself on the sofa, but I could not rest. In a moment I
was up again, moving about, looking at the clock, comparing it with
my watch, wondering what could have happened to make Ivor fail in
keeping his promise to be prompt on the hour of twelve.</p>
<p>Of course, a hundred harmless things might have kept him, but I
thought only of the worst, and was working myself up to a frenzy
when at last I heard the gate-bell. I had been in the house no more
than twelve or fourteen minutes, but it seemed an hour, and I gave
a sob of relief as I rushed out, down the garden path, to let my
visitor in.</p>
<p>Fumbling a little at the lock, always a little difficult if one
were in a hurry, I asked myself what if, as Marianne had suggested,
it were not Ivor Dundas, but someone else&mdash;Raoul,
perhaps&mdash;or the man who had been in her mind: Godensky.</p>
<p>But it was Ivor.</p>
<p>"What news?" I questioned him, my voice sounding queer and far
away in my own ears.</p>
<p>"I don't know whether you'll call it news or not, though plenty
of things have happened. I'm awfully sorry to be late&mdash;"</p>
<p>I wouldn't let him finish, standing there, but took him by the
arm and drew him into the garden, pushing the gate shut behind him
as I did so. Yet I forgot to lock it, and naturally it did not
occur to Ivor that it ought to be fastened.</p>
<p>Once inside, in the garden, I was going to make him begin again,
as I had told Marianne I would. But suddenly I bethought myself
that he might have been followed; that there might be watchers
behind that high wall, watchers who would try to be listeners too,
and whose ears would be very different from old Henri's. "Come into
the house," I said, in a low voice, "before you begin to tell
anything." Then, when we were inside, I could not even wait for him
to go on of his own accord and in his own way.</p>
<p>"The treaty?" I asked. "Have you got hold of it?"</p>
<p>"Unfortunately, no."</p>
<p>"But you've heard of it? Oh, <i>say</i> you've heard
something!"</p>
<p>"If I haven't, it isn't because I've sat down and waited for
news to come. I went back to the Gare du Nord after you left me, to
try and get on the track of the men who travelled with me in the
train to Dover. But I was sent off on the wrong scent, and wasted a
lot of time, worse luck&mdash;I'll tell you about it later, if you
care to hear details. Then, when that game was up, I did what I
wish I'd done at first, found out and consulted a private
detective, said to be one of the best in Paris&mdash;"</p>
<p>"You told your story&mdash;<i>my</i> story&mdash;to a
detective?" I gasped.</p>
<p>"No. Certainly not. I said I'd lost something of value, given me
by a lady whose name I couldn't bring into the affair. I was George
Sandford, too, not Mr. Dundas. I described my travelling
companions, telling all that happened on the way, and offered big
pay if he could find them quickly&mdash;especially the little
fellow. He held out hopes of spotting them to-night, so don't be
desperate, my poor girl. The detective chap seemed really to think
he'd not have much difficulty in tracking down our man; and even if
he's parted with the treaty, we can find out what he's done with
it, no doubt. Girard says&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Girard!" I caught Ivor up. "Is your detective's name Anatole
Girard, and does he live in Rue du Capucin Blanc?"</p>
<p>"Yes. Do you know him?"</p>
<p>"I know too much of him," I answered bitterly.</p>
<p>"Isn't he clever, after all?"</p>
<p>"Far too clever. I'd rather you had gone to any other detective
in Paris&mdash;or to none."</p>
<p>"Why, what's wrong with him?" Ivor began to be distressed.</p>
<p>"Only that he's a personal friend of my worst enemy&mdash;the
man I spoke of to you this evening&mdash;Count Godensky. I've heard
so from Godensky himself, who mentioned the acquaintance once when
Girard had just succeeded in a case everybody was talking
about."</p>
<p>"By Jove, what a beastly coincidence!" exclaimed Ivor, horribly
disappointed at having done exactly the wrong thing, when he had
tried so hard to do the right one. "Yet how could I have dreamed of
it?"</p>
<p>"You couldn't," I admitted, hopelessly. "Nothing is your fault.
All that's happened would have happened just the same, no matter
what messenger the Foreign Secretary had sent to me. It's fate. And
it's my punishment."</p>
<p>"Still, even if Godensky and Girard are friends," Ivor tried to
console me, "it isn't likely that the Count has talked to the
detective about you and the affair of the treaty."</p>
<p>"He may have gone to him for help in finding out things he
couldn't find out himself."</p>
<p>"Hardly, I should say, until there'd been time for him to fear
failure. No, the chances are that Girard will have no inner
knowledge of the matter I've put into his hands; and if he's a man
of honour, he's bound to do the best he can for me, as his
employer. Have you seen du Laurier?"</p>
<p>"Yes. At the theatre. Nothing bad had happened to him yet; but
that brute Godensky has made dreadful mischief between us. If only
I'd known that you would be so late, I might have explained
everything to him."</p>
<p>"I'm very sorry," said Ivor, so humbly and so sadly that I
pitied him (but not half as much as I pitied myself, even though I
hadn't forgotten that hint he had let drop about a great
sacrifice&mdash;a girl he loved, whom he had thrown over, somehow,
to come to me). "I made every effort to be in time. It seems a
piece with the rest of my horrible luck to-day that I was
prevented. I hope, at least, that du Laurier knows about the
necklace?"</p>
<p>"He does, by this," I answered. "Yet I'm afraid he won't be in a
mood to take much comfort from it&mdash;thanks to that wretch. You
know Raoul hasn't a practical bone in his body. He will think I've
deceived him, and nothing else will matter. I must&mdash;" But I
broke off, and laid my hand on Ivor's arm. "What's that?" I
whispered. "Did you hear anything then?"</p>
<p>Ivor shook his head. And we both listened.</p>
<p>"It's a step outside, on the gravel path," said I, my heart
beginning to knock against my side. "I forgot to lock the gate.
Somebody has come into the garden. What if it should be
Raoul&mdash;what if he has seen our shadows on the curtain?"</p>
<p>Mechanically we moved apart, Ivor making a gesture to reassure
me, on account of the position of the lights. He was right. Our
shadows couldn't have fallen on the curtain.</p>
<p>As we stood listening, there came a knock at the front door. It
was Raoul's knock. I was sure of that.</p>
<p>If only Ivor had arrived a quarter of an hour earlier, at the
time appointed, I should have hurried him away before this, so that
I might write to Raoul; but now I could not think what to do for
the best&mdash;what to do, that things might not be made far worse
instead of better between Raoul and me. I had suffered so much that
my power of quick decision, on which I'd so often prided myself
vaingloriously, seemed gone.</p>
<p>"It is Raoul," I said. "What shall I do?"</p>
<p>"Let him in, of course, and introduce me. Don't act as if you
were afraid. Say that I came to see you on important business
concerning a friend of yours in England, and had to call after the
theatre because I'm leaving Paris by the first train in the
morning."</p>
<p>"No use."</p>
<p>"Why not? When a man loves a woman, he trusts her."</p>
<p>"No man of Latin blood, I think. And Raoul's already angry. He
has the right to be&mdash;or would have, if Godensky had been
telling him the truth. And I refused to let him come here. I said I
was going straight to bed, I was so tired. He's knocking again.
Hide yourself, and I'll let him in. Oh, <i>why</i> do you stand
there, looking at me like that? Go into that room," and I pointed,
then pushed him towards the door. "You can get through the window
and out of the garden&mdash;softly&mdash;while Raoul and I are
talking."</p>
<p>"If you insist," said Ivor. "But you're wrong. The best
thing&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Go&mdash;go, I tell you. Don't argue. I know best," I cut him
short, in a sharp whisper, pushing him again.</p>
<p>This time he made no more objections, but went into the
adjoining room, my boudoir. The key was in the door; I turned it in
the lock, snatched it out, and dropped it into a bowl of flowers on
a table close by. That done, I flew out of the drawing-room into
the little entrance hall, and opened the front door. There stood
Raoul, his face dead white, and very stern in the light of the hall
lamp. I had never seen him like that before.</p>
<p>"I know why you're here," I began quickly, before he could
speak. "Count Godensky told me what he said to you. I&mdash;hoped
you would come."</p>
<p>"Is this why you wished to know what I would do if you deceived
me?" he asked, with the bitterest reproach in eyes and voice.</p>
<p>"No. For I hadn't deceived you," I answered. "I haven't deceived
you now. If you loved me, you'd believe me, Raoul."</p>
<p>I put out my hand and took his. He gave mine no pressure, but he
let me draw him into the house.</p>
<p>"For God's sake, give me back my faith in you, if you can," he
said. "It's death to lose it. I came here wanting to die."</p>
<p>"After you'd killed me, as you said?"</p>
<p>"Perhaps. I couldn't keep away. I had to come. If you have any
explanation, for the love of Heaven, tell me what it is."</p>
<p>"You know me, and you know Godensky&mdash;yet you need an
explanation of anything evil said of me by him?" In this way I
hoped to disarm Raoul; but he had been half-mad, I think, and was
scarcely sane now, such a power had jealousy over his better
self.</p>
<p>"Don't play with me!" he exclaimed. "I can't bear it. You sent
me away. Yet you had an appointment with Godensky. You took him
into your carriage; and now&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Marianne was in the carriage. If I could have had you with me,
I should have packed her off by herself, alone, that I&mdash;might
be alone with you. Oh, Raoul, it isn't <i>possible</i> you believe
that I could lie to you for Godensky's sake&mdash;a man like that!
If I'd cared for him, why shouldn't I have accepted him instead of
you? Could I have changed so quickly, do you think?"</p>
<p>"I don't think; I'm not able to think. I can only feel," he
answered.</p>
<p>"Then&mdash;feel sure that I love you&mdash;no man but
you&mdash;now and always."</p>
<p>"Oh, Maxine!" he stammered. "Am I a fool, or wise, to let myself
believe you?"</p>
<p>"You are wise," I answered, as firmly as if I deserved the full
faith I was claiming from him as my right. "If you wouldn't
believe, without my insisting, without my explaining and defending
myself, I'd tell you nothing. But you <i>do</i> believe, just
because you love me&mdash;I see it in your face, and thank God for
it. So I'll tell you this. Count Godensky hates me, because I
couldn't and wouldn't love him, and he hates you because he thinks
I love you. He&mdash;" I paused for a second. A wild thought had
flashed like the light of a beacon in my brain. If I could say
something now which, when the blow fell&mdash;if it did
fall&mdash;might come back to Raoul's mind and convince him
instantly that it was Godensky, not I, who had stolen the treaty
and broken him! If I could make him believe the whole thing a
monstrous plot of Godensky's to revenge himself on a woman who'd
refused him, by cleverly implicating her in her lover's ruin, by
throwing guilt upon her while she was, in reality, innocent! If I
could suggest that to Raoul now, while his ears were open, I might
hold his love against the world, no matter what happened
afterward.</p>
<p>It was a mad idea and a wicked one, perhaps; but I was at my
wits' end and desperate. Though not guilty of this one crime which
I would shift upon his shoulders if I could, as a means of escaping
from the trap he'd helped to set, Godensky was capable of it, and
guilty of others, I was sure, which had never been brought home to
him. I believed that he, too, was a spy, just as I was; and far
worse, because if he were one he betrayed his own country, while I
never had done that, never would.</p>
<p>All these thoughts rushed through my head in a second; and I
think that Raoul could hardly have noticed the pause before I began
to speak again.</p>
<p>"He&mdash;Godensky&mdash;would do anything to part you and me,"
I said. "There's no plot too sly and vile for him to conceive and
carry out against me&mdash;and you. No lie too base for him to tell
you&mdash;or others&mdash;about me. He sent me a letter at the
theatre&mdash;soon after you'd left me the first time. In it, he
said that I must give him a few minutes after the play, unless I
wanted some dreadful harm to come to <i>you</i>&mdash;something
concerning your career. That frightened me, though I might have
guessed it was only a trick. Indeed, I did guess, but I couldn't be
sure, so I saw him. I didn't want you to know&mdash;I tell you that
frankly, Raoul. Because I'd told you not to come home with me, I
hoped you wouldn't find out that I meant to let Count Godensky
drive part of the way back with me and Marianne. I ran the risk,
and&mdash;the very thing happened which I ought to have known would
happen. As for what he had to tell me, it was nothing; only vague
hints of trouble from which he, as one of an inner circle, might
save you, if I&mdash;would be grateful enough."</p>
<p>"The scoundrel!" broke out Raoul, convinced now, his eyes
blazing. "I'll&mdash;"</p>
<p>He stopped suddenly. But I knew what had been on his lips to
say. He meant to send a challenge to Count Godensky. I must prevent
him from doing that.</p>
<p>"No, Raoul," I said, as if he had finished his sentence, "you
musn't fight. For my sake, you mustn't. Don't you see, it's just
what he'd like best? It would be a way of doing me the most
dreadful injury. Think of the scandal. Oh, you <i>will</i> think of
it, when you're cooler. For you, I would not fear much, for I know
what a swordsman you are, and what a shot&mdash;far superior to
Godensky, and with right on your side. But I would fear for myself.
Promise you won't bring this trouble upon me."</p>
<p>"I promise," he answered. "Oh, my darling, what wouldn't I
promise you, to atone for my brutal injustice to an angel? How
thankful I am that I came to you to-night! I meant not to come. I
was afraid of myself, and what I might do. But at last I couldn't
hold out against the something that seemed forcing me here in spite
of all resistance. Do you forgive me?"</p>
<p>"As a reward for your promise," I said, smiling at him through
tears that would come because I was worn out, and because I knew
that it was I who needed his forgiveness, not he mine. "Now are you
happy again?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Yes, I'm happy," he said. "Though on the way to this house I
didn't dream that it would be possible for me to know happiness any
more in this world. And even at your gate&mdash;" He stopped
suddenly, and his face changed. I waited an instant, but seeing
that he didn't mean to go on, I could not resist questioning him. I
had to know what had happened at my gate.</p>
<p>"Even at the gate&mdash;what?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Nothing. I'm sorry I spoke. I want to show you how completely I
trust you now, by not speaking of that."</p>
<p>But this reticence of his only made me more anxious to hear what
he had been going to say. I was afraid that I could guess. But I
must have it from his lips, and be able to explain away the mystery
which, when it recurred to him in the future, might make him doubt
me, even though in this moment of exaltation he did not doubt.</p>
<p>"Yes, speak of it," I said. "All the more because it is nothing.
For it <i>can</i> be nothing."</p>
<p>"I want to punish myself for asking an explanation about
Godensky, by not allowing you to explain this other thing,"
insisted poor, loyal, repentant Raoul. "Then&mdash;at the
time&mdash;it made all the rest seem worse, a thousand times worse.
But I saw through black spectacles. Now I see through rose-coloured
ones."</p>
<p>"I'd rather you saw through your own dear eyes, without any
spectacles. You must tell me what you're thinking of, dear. For my
own sake, if not yours."</p>
<p>"Well&mdash;if you will know. But, remember, darling, I'm going
to put it out of my mind. I'll ask you no questions, I'll
only&mdash;tell you the thing itself. As I said, I didn't come here
directly after seeing Godensky get into your carriage. I wandered
about like a madman&mdash;and I thought of the Seine."</p>
<p>"Oh&mdash;you must indeed have been mad!"</p>
<p>"I was. But that something saved me&mdash;the something that
drove me to find you. I walked here, by roundabout ways, but always
coming nearer and nearer, as if being drawn into a whirlpool. At
last, I was in this street, on the side opposite your house. I
hadn't made up my mind yet, that I would try to see you. I didn't
know what I would do. I stood still, and tried to think. It was
very black, in the angle between two garden walls where the big
plane tree sprouts up, you know. Nobody who didn't expect to find a
man would have noticed me in the darkness. I hadn't been there for
two minutes when a man turned the corner, walking very fast. As he
passed the street lamp just before reaching the garden wall, I saw
him plainly&mdash;not his face, but his figure, and he was young
and well dressed, in travelling clothes. I thought he looked like
an Englishman. He went straight to your gate and rang. A moment
later someone, I couldn't see who, opened the gate and let him in.
Involuntarily I took a step forward, with the idea of
following&mdash;of pushing my way in to see who he was and who had
opened the gate. But I wasn't quite mad enough to act like a cad.
The gate shut. Oh, Maxine, there were evil and cruel thoughts in my
mind, I confess it to you&mdash;but how they made me suffer! I
stood as if I were turned to stone, and I only wished that I might
be, for a stone knows no pain. Just then a motor cab going slowly
along the street stopped in front of your gate. There were two
women in it. I could see them by the light of the street lamp,
though not as plainly as I'd seen the man, and they appeared to be
arguing very excitedly about something. Whatever it was, it must
have been in some way concerned with you, or your affairs, because
they were tremendously interested in the house. They both looked
out, and one pointed several times. Even if I'd intended to go in,
I wouldn't have gone while they were there. But the very fact that
they <i>were</i> there roused me out of the kind of lethargy of
misery I'd fallen into. I wondered who they were, and if they meant
you harm or good. When they had driven away I made up my mind that
I would see you if I could. I tried the gate, and found it
unlocked. I walked in, and&mdash;there were lights in these
windows. I knew you couldn't have gone to bed yet, though you'd
said you were so tired. There was death in my heart then, for you
and for me, Maxine, for&mdash;the gate hadn't opened again,
and&mdash;"</p>
<p>"I know what you thought!" I broke in, my heart beating so now
that my voice shook a little, though I struggled to seem calm. "You
said to yourself, 'It was Maxine who let the man in. He is with her
now. I shall find them together.'"</p>
<p>"Yes," Raoul admitted. "But I didn't try the handle of the door,
as I had of the gate. I rang. I couldn't bring myself to take you
unawares."</p>
<p>"Do you think still that I let a man in, and hid him when I
heard you ring?" I asked. (For an instant I was inclined to tell
the story Ivor had advised me to tell; but I saw how excited Raoul
was; I saw how, in painting the picture for me, he lived through
the scene again, and, in spite of himself, suffered almost as
keenly as he had suffered in the experience. I saw how his
suspicions of me came crawling into his heart, though he strove to
lash them back. I dared not bring Ivor out from the other room, if
he were still there. He was too handsome, too young, too attractive
in every way. If Raoul had been jealous of Count Godensky, whom he
knew I had refused, what would he feel towards Ivor Dundas, a
stranger whose name I had never mentioned, though he was received
at my house after midnight? I was thankful I hadn't taken Ivor's
advice and introduced the two men at first, for in his then mood
Raoul would have listened to no explanations. He and I would never
have arrived at the understanding we had reached now. And not
having been frank at first, I must be secret to the end.)</p>
<p>The very asking of such a bold question&mdash;"Do you think I
let a man in, and hid him?" helped my cause with Raoul.</p>
<p>"No," he said, "I can't think it. I won't, and don't think it.
And you need tell me nothing. I love you. And so help me God, I
won't distrust you again!"</p>
<p>Just as it entered my mind to risk everything on the chance that
Ivor had by this time found his way out, I heard, or fancied I
heard, a faint sound in the next room. He was there still.</p>
<p>Instead of throwing open the door, as it had occurred to me to
do, saying, "Let us look for the man, and make sure no one else let
him in," I laughed out abruptly, as if on a sudden thought, but
really to cover the sound if it should come again.</p>
<p>"Oh, Raoul!" I exclaimed, in the midst of the laughter with
which I surprised him. "You're taking this too seriously. A
thousand times I thank you for trusting me in spite of appearances,
but&mdash;after all, <i>were</i> they so much against me? You seem
to think I am the only young woman in this house. Marianne, poor
dear, is old enough, it's true. But I have a <i>femme de
chambre</i> and a <i>cuisini&egrave;re</i>, both under twenty-five,
both pretty, and both engaged to be married." (This was true. Ah,
what a comfort to speak the truth to him!) "Doesn't it occur to you
that, at this very moment, a couple of lovers may be sitting hand
in hand on the seat under the old yew arbour? Can't you imagine how
they started and tried to hold their breath lest you should hear,
as you opened the gate and came up the path?"</p>
<p>"Forgive me!" murmured Raoul, in the depths of remorse
again.</p>
<p>"Shall we go and look, or shall we leave them in peace?"</p>
<p>"Leave them in peace, by all means."</p>
<p>"The man will be slipping away soon, no doubt. Both
Th&eacute;r&egrave;se and Annette are good little girls."</p>
<p>"Don't let's bother about them. You will be sending me away
soon, too, and I shall deserve it. Brute that I am. You were so
tired, and I&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Oh, I'm better now," I said. "Of course I must send you away by
and by, but not quite yet. First, I want to ask if you weren't glad
when you saw the jewels?"</p>
<p>"Jewels?" echoed Raoul. "What jewels?"</p>
<p>"You don't mean to say you haven't yet opened the little bag I
gave you at the theatre?" I exclaimed.</p>
<p>Raoul looked half ashamed. "Dearest, don't think me ungrateful,"
he said, "but before I had a chance to open it I met Godensky, and
he told me&mdash;that lie. It lit a fire in my brain. I forgot all
about the bag, and haven't thought of it again till this
minute."</p>
<p>At last I laughed with sincerity. "Oh, Raoul, Raoul, you're not
fit for this work-a-day world! Well, I'm glad, after all, that I
shall be with you, when you see what that little insignificant bag
which you've forgotten all this tune has in it. Take it out of your
pocket, and let's open it together."</p>
<p>For the moment I was almost happy; and that Raoul would be
happy, I knew.</p>
<p>His hand went to the inner pocket of his coat, into which I had
seen him put the brocade bag. But it did not come out again. It
groped; and his face flushed. "Good heavens, Maxine," he said, "I
hope you weren't in earnest when you told me that bag held
something very valuable to us both, for I've lost it. You know,
I've been almost mad. I had my handkerchief in that pocket. I must
have pulled it out, and&mdash;"</p>
<p>My knees seemed to give way under me. I half fell onto a
sofa.</p>
<p>"Raoul," I said, in a queer stifled voice, "the bag had in it
the Duchess de Montpellier's diamonds."</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>IVOR GOES INTO THE DARK</h3>
<p>Never had I been caught in a situation which I liked less than
finding myself, long after midnight, locked by Maxine de Renzie
into her boudoir, while within hearing she did her best to convince
her lover that no stranger had come on her account to the
house.</p>
<p>I had never before visited her in Paris, though she had
described her little place there to me when we knew each other in
London; and in groping about trying to find another door or a
window in the dark room, I ran constant risks of making my presence
known by stumbling against the furniture or knocking down some
ornament.</p>
<p>I dared not strike a match because of the sharp, rasping noise
it would make, and I had to be as cautious as if I were treading
with bare feet on glass, although I knew that Maxine was praying
for me to be out of the house, and I was as far from wishing to
linger as she was to have me stay. Only by a miracle did I save
myself once or twice from upsetting a chair or a tall vase of
flowers, on my way to a second door which was locked on the other
side. At last, however, I discovered a window, and congratulated
myself that my trouble and Maxine's danger was nearly over. The
room being on the ground floor, though rather high above the level
of the garden, I thought that I could easily let myself down. But
when I had slipped behind the heavy curtains (they were drawn, and
felt smooth, like satin) it was only to come upon a new
difficulty.</p>
<p>The window, which opened in the middle like most French windows,
was tightly closed, with the catch securely fastened; and as I
began slowly and with infinite caution to turn the handle, I felt
that the window was going to stick. Perhaps the wood had been
freshly painted: perhaps it had swelled; in any case I knew that
when the two sashes consented to part they would make a loud
protest.</p>
<p>After the first warning squeak I stopped. In the next room
Maxine raised her voice&mdash;to cover the sound, I was sure. Then
it had been worse even than I fancied! I dared not begin again. I
would grope about once more, and see if I could hit upon some other
way out, which possibly I had missed.</p>
<p>No, there was nothing. No other window, except a small one which
apparently communicated with a pantry, and even if that had not
seemed too small for me to climb through, it was fastened on the
pantry side.</p>
<p>What to do I did not know. It would be a calamity for Maxine if
du Laurier should hear a sound, and insist on having the door
opened, after she had given him the impression (if she had not said
it in so many words) that there was no stranger in the house.</p>
<p>Probably she hoped that by this time I was gone; but how could I
go? I felt like a rat in a trap: and if I had been a nervous woman
I should have imagined myself stifling in the small, hot room with
its closed doors and windows. As it was, I was uncomfortable
enough. My forehead grew damp, as in the first moments of a Turkish
bath, and absent mindedly I felt in pocket after pocket for my
handkerchief. It was not to be found. I must have lost it at the
hotel, or the detective's, or in the automobile I had hired. In an
outside pocket of my coat, however, I chanced upon something for
the existence of which I couldn't account. It was a very small
something: only a bit of paper, but a very neatly folded bit of
paper, and I remembered how it had fallen from my pocket onto the
floor, and a gendarme had picked it up.</p>
<p>At ordinary times I should most likely not have given it a
second thought; but to-night nothing unexpected could be dismissed
as insignificant until it had been thoroughly examined. I put the
paper back, and as I did so I heard Maxine give an exclamation,
apparently of distress. I could not distinguish all she said, but I
thought that I caught the word "diamonds." For a moment or two she
and du Laurier talked together so excitedly that I might have made
another attack on the window without great risk; and I was
meditating the attempt when suddenly the voices ceased. A door
opened and shut. There was dead silence, except for a footfall
overhead, which sounded heavier than Maxine's. Perhaps it was her
maid's.</p>
<p>For a few seconds more I stood still, awaiting developments, but
there was no sound in the next room, and I decided to take my
chance before it should be too late.</p>
<p>I jerked at the window, which yielded with a loud squeak that
would certainly have given away the secret of my presence if there
had been ears to hear. But all was still in the drawing-room
adjoining, and I dropped down on to a flower bed some few feet
below. Then I skirted round to the front of the house, walking
stealthily on the soft grass, and would have made a noiseless dash
for the gate had I not seen a stream of light flowing out through
the open front door across the lawn. I checked myself just in time
to draw back without being seen by a woman and a tall man moving
slowly down the path. They were Maxine and, no doubt, du Laurier.
They spoke not a word, but walked with their heads bent, as if
deeply absorbed in searching for something on the ground. Down to
the gate they went, opened it and passed out, only half closing it
behind them, so that I knew they meant presently to come back
again.</p>
<p>I should have been thankful to escape, but the chance of meeting
them was too imminent. Accordingly I waited, and it was well I did,
for as they reappeared in three or four minutes they could not have
gone far enough to be out of sight from the gate.</p>
<p>"There's witchcraft in it," Maxine said, as she and her lover
passed within a few yards of me, where I hid behind a little
arbour.</p>
<p>Du Laurier's answer was lost to me, but his voice sounded
despondent. Evidently they had mislaid something of importance and
had small hope of finding it again. I could not help being curious,
as well as sorry for Maxine that a further misfortune should have
befallen her at such a time. But the one and only way in which I
could help her at the moment was to get away as soon as
possible.</p>
<p>They had left the gate unlocked, and I drew in a long breath of
relief when I was on the other side. I hurried out of the street,
lest du Laurier should, by any chance, follow on quickly: and my
first thought was to go immediately back to my hotel, where Girard
might by now have arrived with news. I was just ready to hail a cab
crawling by at a distance, when I remembered the bit of paper I'd
found and put back into my pocket. It occurred to me to have a look
at it, by the light of a street lamp near by; and the instant I had
straightened out the small, crumpled wad I guessed that here was a
link in the mystery.</p>
<p>The paper was a leaf torn from a note-book and closely covered
on both sides with small, uneven writing done with a sharp black
pencil. The handwriting was that of an uneducated person, and was
strange to me. I could not make out the words by the light of the
tall lamp, so I lit a wax match from my match-box, and protecting
the flame in the hollow of my hand, began studying the strange
message.</p>
<p>The three first words sent my heart up with a bound. "On board
the 'Queen.'" I had crossed the Channel in the "Queen," and this
beginning alone was enough to make me hope that the bit of paper
might do more than any detective to unravel the mystery.</p>

  <blockquote class="note">
<p>"I'm taking big risks because I've got to," I read on. "It's my
    only chance. And if you find this, I bet I can trust you. You're
    a gentleman, and you saved my life and a lot more besides by
    getting into that railway-carriage when the other chaps did. The
    minute I seen them I thot I was done for, but you stopped there
    game. I'm a jewler's assistant, carrying property worth
    thousands, for my employers. From the first I knew 'twas bound
    to be a ticklish job. On this bote I'm safe, for the villions
    who would have murdered and robbed me in the train if it hadn't
    been for you being there, won't have a chance, but when I get to
    Paris it will be the worst, and no hope for the jewls, followed
    as I am, if I hadn't already thot of a plan to save them through
    you, an honest gentleman far above temptashun. I know who you
    are, for I've seen your photo in the papers. So, what I did was
    this: to try a ventriloquist trick which has offen bin of use in
    my carere, just as folks were on the boat's gangway. Thro'
    making that disturbance, and a little skill I have got by doing
    amatoor conjuring to amuse my wife and famly, I was able to slip
    the case of my employer's jewls into your breast pocket without
    your knowing. And I had to take away what you had in, not that I
    wanted to rob one who had done good by me, but because if I'd
    left it the double thickness would have surprised you and you
    would probably have pulled out my case to see what it was. Then
    my fat would have bin in the fire, with certin persons looking
    on, and you in danger as well as me which wouldn't be fare. I've
    got your case in my pocket as I write, but I won't open it
    because it may have your sweetart's letters in. You can get your
    property again by bringing me my master's, which is fare
    exchange. I can't call on you, for I don't know where your going
    and daren't hang round to see on account of the danger I run,
    and needing to meet a pal of mine who will help me. I must get
    to him at once, if I am spared to do so, for which reason I
    wrote out this explanashun. The best I can do is to slip it in
    your pocket which I shall try when in the railway stashun at
    Paris. You see how I trust you as a gentleman to bring me the
    jewls. Come as soon as you can, and get your own case instead,
    calling at 218 Rue Fille Sauvage, Avenue Morot, back room, top
    floor, left of passage. Expressing my gratitood in advance,</p>

</blockquote>
<p>If it had not been for my rage at not having read this
illuminating little document earlier, I should have felt like
shouting with joy. As it was, my delight was tempered with enough
of regret to make it easier to restrain myself.</p>
<p>But for the fear that du Laurier might be still with Maxine, I
should have rushed back to her house for a moment, just long enough
to give her the good news. But in the circumstances I dared not do
it, lest she should curse instead of bless me: and besides, as
there was still a chance of disappointment, it might be better in
any case not to raise her hopes until there was no danger of
dashing them again. The best thing was to get the treaty back,
without a second of delay. As for the detective, who was perhaps
waiting for me at the hotel, he would have to wait longer, or even
go away disgusted&mdash;nothing made much difference now. Maybe,
when once I had the treaty in my hands, I might send a messenger
with a few cautious words to Maxine. No matter how late the hour,
she was certain not to be asleep.</p>
<p>The cab I had seen crawling through the street had disappeared
long ago, and no other was in sight, so I walked quickly on, hoping
to find one presently. It was now so late, however, that in this
quiet part of Paris no carriages of any sort were plying for hire.
Finally I made up my mind that I should have to go all the way on
foot; but I knew the direction of the Avenue Morot, though I'd
never heard of Rue de la Fille Sauvage, and as it was not more than
two miles to walk, I could reach the house I wanted to find in half
an hour.</p>
<p>A few minutes more or less ought not to matter much, since "J.
M." was sure to be awaiting me with impatience; therefore the thing
which bothered me most was the effect likely to be produced on the
man when I could not hand him over the diamonds in exchange for the
treaty.</p>
<p>Of course I didn't believe that "J.M." was a jeweller's
messenger, though possibly I might have been less incredulous if
Maxine had not told me the true history of the diamonds, and what
had happened in Holland. As it was, I had very little doubt that
the rat of a man I had chanced to protect in the railway carriage
was no other than the extraordinarily expert thief who had relieved
du Laurier of the Duchess's necklace.</p>
<p>Following out a theory which I worked up as I walked, I thought
it probable that the fellow had been helped by confederates whom he
had contrived to dodge, evading them and sneaking off to London in
the hope of cheating them out of their share of the spoil. Followed
by them, dreading their vengeance, I fancied him flitting from one
hiding-place to another, not daring to separate himself from the
jewels; at last determining to escape, disguised, from England,
where the scent had become too hot; reserving a first-class
carriage in the train to Dover, and travelling with a golfer's kit;
struck with panic at the last moment on seeing the very men he fled
to avoid, close on his heels, and opening the door of his reserved
carriage with a railway key.</p>
<p>All this was merely deduction, for so far as I had seen,
"J.M.'s" travelling companions hadn't even accosted him. Still, the
theory accounted for much that had been puzzling, and made it
plausible that a man should be desperate enough to trust his
treasure to a stranger (known only through "photos in the
newspapers") rather than risk losing it to those he had
betrayed.</p>
<p>I resolved to use all my powers of diplomacy to extract from
"J.M." the case containing the treaty before he learned that he was
not to receive the diamonds in its place; and I had no more than
vaguely mapped out a plan of proceeding before I arrived in the
Avenue Morot. Thence I soon found my way into the Rue de la Fille
Sauvage, a mean street, to which the queer name seemed not
inappropriate. The house I had to visit was an ugly big box of a
building, with rooms advertised to let, as I could see by the light
of a street lamp across the way, which gleamed bleakly on the lines
of shut windows behind narrow iron balconies.</p>
<p>The large double doors, from which the paint had peeled in
patches, were closed, but I rang the bell for the concierge; and
after a delay of several minutes I heard a slight click which meant
that the doors had opened for me. I passed into a dim lobby, to be
challenged by a sleepy voice behind a half open window. The owner
of the voice kept himself invisible and was no doubt in the bunk
which he called his bed. Only a stern sense of duty as concierge
woke him up enough to demand, mechanically, who it was that the
strange monsieur desired to visit at this late hour?</p>
<p>I replied according to instructions. I wished to see Monsieur
Gestre.</p>
<p>"Monsieur Gestre is away," murmured the voice behind the little
window.</p>
<p>I thought quickly. Gestre was probably the "pal" whom "J.M." had
been in such a hurry to find. "Very well," said I, "I'll see his
friend, the Englishman who arrived this evening. I have an
appointment with him."</p>
<p>"Ah, I understand. I remember. Is it not that Monsieur has been
here already? He now returns, as he mentioned that he might
do?"</p>
<p>Again my thoughts made haste to arrange themselves. The
"monsieur" who had called had probably also arrived late, after the
concierge had gone to bed in his dim box, and become too drowsy to
notice such details as the difference between voices, especially if
they were those of foreigners. Perhaps if I explained that I was
not the person who had said he would come again, but another, the
man behind the window would consider me a complication, and refuse
to let me pass at such an hour without a fuss. And of all things, a
fuss was what I least wanted&mdash;for Maxine's sake, and because
of the treaty. I decided to seize upon the advantage that was
offered me.</p>
<p>"Quite right," I said shortly. "I know the way." And so began to
mount the stairs. Flight after flight I went up, meeting no one;
and on the fifth floor I found that I had reached the top of the
house. There were no more stairs to go up.</p>
<p>On each of the floors below there had been a dim light&mdash;a
jet of gas turned low. But the fifth floor was in darkness. Someone
had put out the light, either in carelessness or for some special
reason.</p>
<p>There were several doors on each side of the passage, but I
could not be sure that I had reached the right one until I'd
lighted a match. When I was sure, I knocked, but no answer
came.</p>
<p>"He can't be out," I said to myself, cheerfully. "He's got tired
of waiting and dropped asleep, that's all."</p>
<p>I knocked again. Silence. And then for a third time, loudly,
keeping on until I was sure that, if there were anyone in the room,
no matter how sound asleep, I must have waked him.</p>
<p>After all, he had gone out, but perhaps only for a short time.
Surely, he would soon come back, lest he should miss the keeper of
the diamonds.</p>
<p>I had very little hope that, even on the chance of my arriving
while he was away, he would have left the door open. Nevertheless I
tried the handle, and to my surprise it yielded.</p>
<p>"That must be because the lock's broken and only a bolt
remains," I thought. "So he had to take the risk. All the better.
This looks as if he'd be back any minute. He wouldn't like giving
the enemy a chance to find his lair and step into it before him."
It was dark in the room, and I struck another wax match just inside
the threshold. But I had hardly time to get an impression of
bareness and meanness of furnishing before a draught of air from an
open window blew out the struggling flame and at the same instant
banged the door shut behind me.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>IVOR FINDS SOMETHING IN THE DARK</h3>
<p>There was a strong smell of paraffin oil in the room; and from
somewhere at the far end came a faint tap, tapping sound, which
might be the light knocking of a window-blind or the rap of a
signalling finger.</p>
<p>If I could steer my way to the window and pull back the drawn
curtains I might be able to let in light enough to find matches on
mantelpiece or table. Then, what good luck if I should discover the
case containing the treaty and go off with it before "J.M." came
back! It was not his, and he was a thief: therefore, I should be
doing him no wrong and Maxine de Renzie much good by taking it, if
he had left it behind, not too well hidden when he went out.</p>
<p>Guided in the darkness by a slight breeze which still came
through the window, though the door was now shut, I shuffled across
the uncarpeted floor, groping with hands held out before me as I
moved.</p>
<p>In a moment I brushed against a table, then struck my shin on
something which proved to be the leg of a chair lying over-turned
on the floor. I pushed it out of the way, but had gone on no more
than three or four steps when I caught my foot in a rug which had
got twisted in a heap round the fallen chair. I disentangled myself
from its coils, only to slip and almost lose my balance by stepping
into some spilled liquid which lay thick and greasy on the bare
boards.</p>
<p>The warm hopefulness which I had brought into this dark, silent
room was chilled and dying now.</p>
<p>"I'm afraid there's been a struggle here," I thought. And if
there had been a struggle&mdash;what of the treaty?</p>
<p>There seemed to be a good deal of the spilled liquid, for as I
felt my way along, more anxious than ever for light, the floor was
still wet and slippery; and then, in the midst of the puddle, I
stumbled over a thing that was heavy and soft to the touch of my
foot.</p>
<p>A queer tingling, like the sting of a thousand tiny electric
needles prickled through my veins, for even before I stooped and
laid my hand on that barrier which was so heavy and yet so soft as
it stopped my path, I knew what it would prove to be.</p>
<p>It was as if I could see through the dark, to what it hid. But
though there was no surprise left, there was a shock of horror as
my fingers touched an arm, a throat, an upturned face. And my
fingers were wet, as I knew my boots must be. And I knew, too, with
what they were wet.</p>
<p>I'm ashamed to say that, after the first shock of the discovery,
my impulse was to get away, and out of the whole business, in
which, for reasons which concerned others even more than myself, it
would be unpleasant to be involved, just at this time especially. I
could go downstairs now, past the sleeping concierge, and with luck
no one need ever know that I had been in this dark room of
death.</p>
<p>But as quickly as the impulse came, it went. I must stop here
and search for the treaty, no matter what happened, until I had
found it or made sure it was not to be found; I must not think of
escape. If there were matches in the room, well and good; if not, I
must go elsewhere for them, and come back. It was a grim task, but
it had to be done.</p>
<p>Somehow, I got to the mantelpiece; and there luckily, among a
litter of pipes and bottles and miscellaneous rubbish, I did lay my
hand on a broken cup containing a few matches. I struck one, which
showed me on the mantel an end of a candle standing up in a bed of
its own grease. I lighted it, and not until the flame was burning
brightly did I look round.</p>
<p>There was but a faint illumination, yet it was enough to give me
the secret of the room. I might have seen all at a glance as I came
in, before the light of my last match was blown out by the wind,
had not the door as I opened it formed a screen between me and the
dead man on the floor.</p>
<p>He lay in the midst of the wildest confusion. In falling, he had
dragged with him the cover of a table, and a glass lamp which was
smashed in pieces, the spilled oil mingling with the stream of his
blood. A chair had been overturned, and a broken plate and tumbler
with the tray that had held them were half hidden in the folds of a
disordered rug.</p>
<p>But this was not all. The struggle for life did not account for
the condition of other parts of the room. Papers were scattered
over the floor: the drawers of an old escritoire had been jerked
out of place and their contents strewn far and near. The doors of a
wardrobe were open, and a few shabby coats and pairs of trousers
thrown about, with the pockets wrong side out or torn in rags. A
chest of drawers had been ransacked, and a narrow, hospital bed
stripped of sheets and blankets, the stuffing of the mattress
pulled into small pieces. The room looked as if a whirlwind had
swept through it, and as I forced myself to go near the body I saw
that it had not been left in peace by the murderer. The
blood-stained coat was open, the pockets of the garments turned
out, like those in the wardrobe, and all the clothing disarranged,
evidently by hands which searched for something with frenzied haste
and merciless determination.</p>
<p>The cunning forethought of the wretched man had availed him
nothing. I could imagine how joyously he had arrived at this house,
believing that he had outwitted the enemy. I pictured his
disappointment on not finding the friend who could have helped and
supported him. I saw how he had planned to defend himself in case
of siege, by locking and bolting the door (both lock and bolt were
broken); I fancied him driven by hunger to search his friend's
quarters for food, and fearfully beginning a supper in the midst of
which he had probably been interrupted. Almost, I could feel the
horror with which he must have trembled when steps came along the
corridor, when the door was tried and finally broken in by force
without any cry of his being heard. I guessed how he had rushed to
the window, opened it, only to stare down at the depths below and
return desperately, to stand at bay; to protest to the avengers
that he had not the jewels; that he had been deceived; that he was
innocent of any intention to defraud them; that he would explain
all, make anything right if only they would give him time.</p>
<p>But they had not given him time. They had punished him for
robbing them of the diamonds by robbing him of his life. They had
made him pay with the extreme penalty for his treachery; and yet in
the flickering candle-light the stricken face, blood-spattered
though it was, seemed to leer slyly, as if in the knowledge that
they had been cheated in the end.</p>
<p>The confusion of the room promised badly for my hopes,
nevertheless there was a chance that the murderers, intent only on
finding the diamonds or some letters relating to their disposal,
might, if they found the treaty, have hastily flung it aside, as a
thing of no value.</p>
<p>Though the corridors of the house were lit by gas, this room had
none, and the lamp being broken, I had to depend upon the bit of
candle which might fail while I still had need of it. I separated
it carefully from its bed of grease on the mantel, and as I did so
the wavering light touched my hand and shirt cuff. Both were
stained red, and I turned slightly sick at the sight. There was
blood on my brown boots, too, and the grey tweed clothes which I
had not had time to change since arriving in Paris.</p>
<p>I told myself that I must do my best to wash away these
tell-tale stains before leaving the room; but first I would look
for the treaty.</p>
<p>I began my search by stirring up the mass of scattered papers on
the floor, and in spite of the horror which gripped me by the
throat, I cried "hurrah!" when, half hidden by the twisted rug, I
saw the missing letter-case. It was lying spread open, back
uppermost, and there came an instant of despair when I pounced on
it only to find it empty. But there was the treaty on the floor
underneath; and lucky it was that the searchers had thrown it out,
for there were gouts of blood on the letter-case, while the treaty
was clean and unspotted.</p>
<p>With a sense of unutterable relief which almost made up for
everything endured and still to be endured, I slipped the document
back into the pocket from which it had been stolen.</p>
<p>At that moment a board creaked in the corridor, and then came a
step outside the door.</p>
<p>My blood rushed up to my head. But it was not of myself I
thought; it was of the treaty. If I were to be caught here, alone
with the dead man, my hands and clothing stained with his blood, I
should be arrested. The treaty must not be found on me. Yet I must
hide it, save it. I made a dash for the window, and once outside,
standing on the narrow balcony, I threw the candle-end into the
room, aiming for the fire-place. Faint starlight, sifting through
heavy clouds, showed me a row of small flower-pots standing in a
wooden box. Hastily I wrapped the treaty in a towel which hung over
the iron railing, lifted out two of the flower-pots (in which the
plants were dead and dry), laid the flat parcel I had made in the
bottom of the box, and replaced the pots to cover and conceal it.
Then I walked back into the room again. A hand, fumbling at the
handle of the door, pushed it open with a faint creaking of the
hinges. Then the light of a dark lantern flashed.</p>

<h2>DIANA FORREST'S PART</h2>
<a name="2HCH14"><!-- H2 anchor --></a>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>DIANA TAKES A MIDNIGHT DRIVE</h3>
<p>Some people apparently understand how to be unhappy gracefully,
as if it were a kind of fine art. I don't. It seems too bad to be
true that I should be unhappy, and as if I must wake up to find
that it was only a bad dream.</p>
<p>I suppose I've been spoiled a good deal all my life. Everybody
has been kind to me, and tried to do things for my pleasure, just
as I have for them; and I have taken things for
granted&mdash;except, of course, with Lisa. But Lisa is
different&mdash;different from everyone else in the world. I have
never expected anything from her, as I have from others. All I've
wanted was to make her as happy as such a poor, little, piteous
creature could be, and to teach myself never to mind anything that
she might say or do.</p>
<p>But Ivor&mdash;to be disappointed in him, to be made miserable
by him! I didn't know it was possible to suffer as I suffered that
day he went off and left me standing in the railway-station. I
didn't dream then of going to Paris. If anybody had told me I would
go, I should have said, "No, no, I will not." And yet I did. I
allowed myself to be persuaded. I tried to make myself think that
it was to please Aunt Lilian; but down underneath I knew all the
time it wasn't that, really. It was because I couldn't bear to do
the things I'm accustomed to doing every day. I felt as if I should
cry, or scream, or do something ridiculous and awful unless there
were a change of some sort&mdash;any change, but if possible some
novelty and excitement, with people talking to me every minute.</p>
<p>Perhaps, too, there was an attraction for me in the thought that
I would be in Paris while Ivor was there. I kept reminding myself
on the boat and the train that nothing good could happen; that Ivor
and I could never be as we had been before; that it was all over
between us for ever and ever, and through his fault. But, there at
the bottom was the thought that I <i>might</i> have done him an
injustice, because he had begged me to trust him, and I wouldn't.
Just suppose&mdash;something in myself kept on saying&mdash;that we
should by mere chance meet in Paris, and he should be able to prove
that he hadn't come for Maxine de Renzie's sake! It would be too
glorious. I should begin to live again&mdash;for already I'd found
out that life without loving and trusting Ivor wasn't life at
all.</p>
<p>He couldn't think I had followed him, even if he did see me in
Paris, because I would be with my Aunt and Uncle, and Lord Robert
West; and I made up my mind to be very nice to Lord Bob, much nicer
than I ever had been, if Ivor happened to run across us
anywhere.</p>
<p>Then that very thing did happen, in the strangest and most
unexpected way, but instead of being happier for seeing him, I was
ten times more unhappy than before&mdash;for now the misery had no
gleam of hope shining through its blackness.</p>
<p>That was what I told myself at first. But after we had met in
the hall of the hotel, and Ivor had seemed confused, and wouldn't
give up his mysterious engagement, or say what it was, though Lisa
chaffed him and he <i>must</i> have known what I thought, I
suddenly forgot the slight he had put upon me. Instead of being
angry with him, I was <i>afraid</i> for him, I couldn't have
explained why, unless it was the look on his face when he turned
away from me.</p>
<p>No man would look like that who was going of his own free will
to a woman with whom he was in love, that same queer something
whispered in my ear. Instead of feeling sick and sorry for myself
and desperately angry with him, it was Ivor I felt sorry for.</p>
<p>I pretended not to care whether he stayed or went, and talked to
Lord Robert West as if I'd forgotten that there was such a person
as Ivor Dundas. I even turned my back on him before he was gone.
Still I seemed to see the tragic look in his eyes, and the dogged
set of his jaw. It was just as if he were going away from me to his
death; and his face was like that of the man in Millais' picture of
the Huguenot Lovers. I wondered if that girl had been
broken-hearted because he wouldn't let her tie round his arm the
white scarf that might have saved him.</p>
<p>It is strange how one's mood can change in a moment&mdash;but
perhaps it is like that only with women. A minute before I'd been
trying to despise Ivor, and to argue, just as if I'd been a
match-making mamma, to myself that it would be a very good thing if
I could make up my mind to marry Lord Bob; that it would be rather
nice being a Duchess some day; and that besides, perhaps Ivor would
be sorry when he heard that I was engaged to somebody else.</p>
<p>But then, as I said, quite suddenly it was as if a sharp knife
had been stuck into my heart and turned round and round. I would
have given anything to run after Ivor to tell him that I loved him
dreadfully and would trust him in spite of all.</p>
<p>"You look as pale as if you were going to faint," said Lisa, in
her little high-keyed voice, which, though she doesn't speak
loudly, always reaches to the farthest corners of the biggest
rooms.</p>
<p>I did think it was unkind of her to call everyone's attention to
me just then, for even strangers heard, and turned to throw a
glance at me as they passed.</p>
<p>"It must be the light," I said, "for I don't feel in the least
faint." That was a fib, because when you are as miserable as I was
at that minute your heart feels cold and heavy, as though it could
hardly go on beating. But I felt that if ever a fib were excusable,
that one was. "I'm a little tired, though," I went on. "None of us
got to bed till after three last night; and this day, though very
nice of course, has been rather long. I think, if you don't mind,
Aunt Lil, I'll go straight to my room when we get upstairs."</p>
<p>We all went up together in the lift, but I said good-night to
the others at the door of the pretty drawing-room at the end of
Uncle Eric's suite.</p>
<p>"Shan't I come with you?" asked Lisa, but I said "no." It was
something new for her to offer to help me, for she isn't very
strong, and has always been the one to be petted and watched over
by me, though she's a few years older than I am.</p>
<p>Aunt Lilian had brought her maid, without whom she can't get on
even for a single night, but Lisa and I had left ours at home, and
Aunt Lil had offered to let Morton help us as much as we liked. I
hadn't been shut up in my room for two minutes, therefore, when
Morton knocked to ask if she could do anything. But I thanked her,
and sent her away.</p>
<p>I had not yet begun to undress, but was standing in the window,
looking along the Champs &Eacute;lys&eacute;es, brilliant still
with electric lights, and full of carriages and motor-cars bringing
people home from theatres and dinner-parties, or taking them to
restaurants for supper.</p>
<p>Down there somewhere was Ivor, going farther away from me every
moment, though last night at about this time he had been telling me
how he loved me, how I was the One Girl in the world for him, and
always, always would be. Here was I, remembering in spite of myself
every word he had said, hearing again the sound of his voice and
seeing the look in his eyes as he said it. There was he, going to
the woman for whose sake he had been willing to break with me.</p>
<p>But was he going to her? I asked myself. If not, when they had
chaffed him he might easily have mentioned what his engagement
really was, knowing, as he must have known, exactly how he made me
suffer.</p>
<p>Still&mdash;why had he looked so miserable, if he didn't care
what I thought, and was really ready to throw me over at a call
from her? The whole thing began to appear more complicated, more
mysterious than I had felt it to be at first, when I was smarting
with my disappointment in Ivor, and tingling all over with the
humiliation he seemed to have put upon me.</p>
<p>"Oh, to know, to <i>know</i>, what he's doing at this minute!" I
whispered, half aloud, because it was comforting in my loneliness
to hear the sound of my own voice. "To <i>know</i> whether I'm
doing him the most awful injustice&mdash;or not!"</p>
<p>Just then, at the door between my room and Lisa's, next to mine,
came a tapping, and instantly after the handle was tried. But I had
turned the key, thinking that perhaps this very thing might
happen&mdash;that Lisa might wish to come, and not wait till I'd
given her permission. She does that sort of thing sometimes, for
she is rather curious and impish (Ivor calls her "Imp"), and if she
thinks people don't want her that is the very time when she most
wants them.</p>
<p>"Oh, Di, do let me in!" she exclaimed.</p>
<p>For a second or two I didn't answer. Never in my life had I
liked poor Lisa less than I'd liked her for the last four and
twenty hours, though I'd told myself over and over again that she
meant well, that she was acting for my good, and that some day I
would be grateful instead of longing to slap her, as I couldn't
help doing now. But always before, when she has irritated me until
I've nearly forgotten my promise to her father (my step-father)
always to be gentle with her in thought and deed, I have felt such
pangs of remorse that I've tried to atone, even when there wasn't
really anything to atone for, except in my mind. I was afraid that,
if I refused to let her come in, she would go to bed angry with me.
And when Lisa is angry she generally has a heart attack and is ill
next day. "Di, are you there?" she called again.</p>
<p>Without answering, I went to the door and unlocked it. She came
in with a rush. "I feel perfectly wild, as if I must do something
desperate," she said.</p>
<p>So did I, but I didn't mean to let her know that.</p>
<p>"I'm going out," she went on. "If I don't, I shall have a
fit."</p>
<p>"Out!" I repeated. "You can't. It's midnight."</p>
<p>"Can't? There's no such word for me as 'can't,' when I want to
do anything, and you ought to know that," said she. "It's only
being ill that ever stops me, and I'm not ill to-night. I feel as
if electricity were flowing all through me, making my nerves jump,
and I believe you feel exactly the same way. Your eyes are as big
as half-crowns, and as black as ink."</p>
<p>"I <i>am</i> a little nervous," I confessed. And I couldn't help
thinking it odd that Lisa and I should both be feeling that
electrical sensation at the same time. "Perhaps it's in the air.
Maybe there's going to be a thunder-storm. There are clouds over
the stars, and a wind coming up."</p>
<p>"Maybe it's partly that, maybe not," said she. "But there's one
thing I'm sure of. <i>Something's going to happen.</i>"</p>
<p>"Do you feel that, too?" I broke out before I'd stopped to
think. Then I wished I hadn't. But it was too late to wish. Lisa
caught me up quickly.</p>
<p>"Ah, I <i>knew</i> you did!" she cried, looking as eerie and
almost as haggard as a witch. "Something <i>is</i> going to happen.
Come. Go with me and be in it, whatever it is."</p>
<p>"No," I said. "And you mustn't go either." But she was weird.
She seemed to lure me, like a strange little siren, with all a
siren's witchery, though without her beauty. My voice sounded
undecided, and I knew it.</p>
<p>"Of course I'm not asking you to wander with me in the night,
hand in hand through the streets of Paris, like the Two Orphans,"
said Lisa. "I'm going to have a closed carriage&mdash;a
motor-brougham, one belonging to the hotel, so it's quite safe.
It's ordered already, and I shall first drive and drive until my
nerves stop jerking and my head throbbing. If you won't drive with
me I shall drive alone. But there'll be no harm in it, either way.
I didn't know you were so conventional as to think there could be.
Where's your brave, independent American spirit?"</p>
<p>"I'm not conventional," I said.</p>
<p>"Yes, you are. Living in England has spoiled you. You're afraid
of things you never used to be afraid of."</p>
<p>"I'm not afraid of things, and I'm not a bit changed," I said.
"You only want to 'dare' me."</p>
<p>"I want you to go with me. It would be so much nicer than going
alone," she begged. "Supposing I got ill in a hired cab? I might,
you know; but I <i>can't</i> stay indoors, whatever happens. If we
were together it would be an adventure worth remembering."</p>
<p>"Very well," I said, "I'll go with you, not for the adventure,
but rather than have you make a fuss because I try to keep you in,
and rather than you should go alone."</p>
<p>"Good girl!" exclaimed Lisa, quite pleasant and purring, now
that she had got her way; though if I'd refused she would probably
have cried. She is terrifying when she cries. Great, deep sobs seem
almost to tear her frail little body to pieces. She goes deadly
white, and sometimes ends up by a fit of trembling as if she were
in an ague.</p>
<p>"Have you really ordered a motor cab?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Yes," said she. "I rang for a waiter, and sent him down to tell
the big porter at the front door to get me one. Then I gave him
five francs, and said I did not want anybody to know, because I
must visit a poor, sick friend who had written to say she was in
great trouble, but wished to tell no one except me that she'd come
to Paris."</p>
<p>"I shouldn't have thought such an elaborate story necessary to a
waiter," I remarked, tossing up my chin a little, for I don't like
Lisa's subterranean ways. But this time she didn't even try to
defend herself.</p>
<p>"Let's get ready at once," she said. "I'm going to put on my
long travelling cloak, to cover up this dress, and wear my black
toque, with a veil. I suppose you'll do the same? Then we can slip
out, and down the 'service' stairs. The carriage is to wait for us
at the side entrance."</p>
<p>I looked at her, trying to read her secretive little face.
"Lisa, are you planning to go somewhere in particular, do something
you want to 'spring' on me when it's too late for me to get out of
it?"</p>
<p>"How horrid of you to be so suspicious of me! You <i>do</i> hurt
my feelings! I haven't had an inspiration yet, so I can't make a
plan. But it will come; I know it will. I shall <i>feel</i> where
we ought to go, to be in the midst of an adventure&mdash;oh,
without being mixed up in it, so don't look horrified! I told you
that something was going to happen, and that I wanted to be in it.
Well, I mean to be, when the inspiration comes."</p>
<p>We put on our dark hats and long travelling cloaks. I pinned on
Lisa's veil, and my own. Then she peeped to see if anyone were
about; but there was nobody in the corridor. We hurried out, and as
Lisa already knew where to find the 'service' stairs, we were soon
on the way down. At the side entrance of the hotel the motor-cab
was waiting, and when we were both seated inside, Lisa spoke in
French to the driver, who waited for orders.</p>
<p>"I think you might take us to the Rue d'Hollande. Drive fast,
please. After that, I'll tell you where to go next."</p>
<p>"Is this your 'inspiration'?" I asked.</p>
<p>"I'm not sure yet. Why?" and her voice was rather sharp.</p>
<p>"For no particular reason. I'm a little curious, that's
all."</p>
<p>We drove on for some minutes in silence. I was sure now that
Lisa had been playing with me, that all along she had had some
special destination in her mind, and that she had her own reasons
for wanting to bring me to it. But what use to ask more questions?
She did not mean me to find out until she was ready for me to
know.</p>
<p>She had told the man to go quickly, and he obeyed. He rushed us
round corners and through street after street which I had never
seen before&mdash;quiet streets, where there were no cabs, and no
gay people coming home from theatres and dinners. At last we turned
into a particularly dull little street, and stopped.</p>
<p>"Is this the Rue d'Hollande?" Lisa enquired of the driver,
jumping quickly up and putting her head out of the window.</p>
<p>"<i>Mais oui, Mademoiselle</i>," I heard the man answer.</p>
<p>"Then stop where you are, please, until I give you new
orders."</p>
<p>"I should have thought this was the sort of street where nothing
could possibly happen," said I.</p>
<p>"Wait a little, and maybe you'll find out you're mistaken. If
nothing does, and we aren't amused, we can go on somewhere
else."</p>
<p>She had not finished speaking when a handsome electric carriage
spun almost noiselessly round the corner. It slowed down before a
gate set in a high wall, almost covered with creepers, and though
the street was dimly lighted and we had stopped at a little
distance, I could see that the house behind the wall, though not
large, was very quaint and pretty, an unusual sort of house for
Paris, it seemed to me.</p>
<p>Scarcely had the electric carriage come to a halt when the
chauffeur, in neat, dark livery, jumped down to open the door; and
quickly a tall, slim woman sprang out, followed by another, elderly
and stout, who looked like a lady's maid.</p>
<p>I could not see the face of either, but the light of the lamp on
our side of the way shone on the hair of the slim young woman in
black, who got down first. It was gorgeous hair, the colour of
burnished copper. I had heard a man say once that only two women in
the world had hair of that exact shade: Jane Hading and Maxine de
Renzie.</p>
<p>My heart gave a great bound, and I guessed in an instant why
Lisa had brought me here, though how she could have learned where
to find the house, I didn't know.</p>
<p>"Oh, Lisa!" I reproached her. "How <i>could</i> you?"</p>
<p>"It really <i>was</i> an inspiration. I'm sure of that now," she
said quietly, though I could tell by her tone that she was trying
to hide excitement. "You never saw that woman before, except once
on the stage, yet you know who she is. You jumped as if she had
fired a shot at you."</p>
<p>"I know by the hair," I answered. "I might have foreseen this
would be the kind of thing you would think of&mdash;it's like
you."</p>
<p>"You ought to be grateful to me for thinking of it," said Lisa.
"It's entirely for your sake; and it's quite true, it was an
inspiration to come here. This afternoon in the train I read an
interview in 'Femina' with Maxine de Renzie, about the new play
she's produced to-night. There was a picture of her, and a
description of her house in the Rue d'Hollande."</p>
<p>"Now you have satisfied your curiosity. You've seen her back,
and her maid's back, and the garden wall," I said, more sharply
than I often speak to Lisa. "I shall tell the driver to take us to
the hotel at once. I know why you want to wait here, but you
shan't&mdash;I won't. I'm going away as quickly as I can."</p>
<p>She caught my dress as I would have leaned out to speak to the
driver. Her manner had suddenly changed, and she was all softness
and sweetness, and persuasiveness.</p>
<p>"Di, dearest girl, <i>don't</i> be cross with me; please don't
misunderstand," she implored. "I love you, you know, even if you
sometimes think I don't; I want you to be happy&mdash;oh, wait a
moment, and listen. I've been so miserable all day, knowing you
were miserable; and I've felt horribly guilty for fear, after all,
I'd said too much. Of course if you'd guessed where I meant to
come, you wouldn't have stirred out of the hotel, and it was better
for you to see for yourself. Unless Ivor Dundas came here with a
motor-cab, as we did, he could hardly have arrived yet, so if he
does come, we shall know. If he <i>doesn't</i> come, we shall know,
too. Think how happy you'll feel if he <i>doesn't!</i> I'll
apologise to you then, frankly and freely; and I suppose you would
not mind apologising to him, if necessary?"</p>
<p>"He may be in the house now," I said, more to myself than to
Lisa.</p>
<p>"If he is, he'll come out and meet her when he hears the gate
open. There, it's open now. The maid's unlocked it. No, there's
nobody in the garden."</p>
<p>"I can't stop here and watch for him, like a spy," I said.</p>
<p>"Not like a spy, but like a girl who thinks she may have done a
man an injustice. It's for <i>his</i> sake I ask you to stay. And
if you won't, I must stay alone. If you insist on going away, I'll
get out and stand in the street, either until Ivor Dundas has come,
or until I'm sure he isn't coming. But how much better to wait and
see for yourself."</p>
<p>"You know I can't go off and leave you standing here," I
answered. "And I can't leave you sitting in the carriage, and walk
through the streets alone. I might meet&mdash;" I would not finish
my sentence, but Lisa must nave guessed the name on my lips.</p>
<p>"The only thing to do, then, is for us to stop where we are,
together," said Lisa, "for stop I must and shall, in justice to
myself, to Ivor Dundas and to you. You couldn't force me away, even
if you wanted to use force."</p>
<p>"Which you know is out of the question," I said, desperately.
"But why has your conscience begun to reproach you for trying to
put me against Ivor? You seemed to have no scruples whatever, last
night and this morning."</p>
<p>"I've been thinking hard since then. I want my warning to you
either to be justified, or else I want to apologise humbly. For if
Ivor doesn't come to this house to-night, in spite of his
embarrassment when he spoke about an engagement, I shall believe
that he doesn't care a rap about Maxine de Renzie."</p>
<p>I said no more, but leaned back against the cushions, my heart
beating as if it were in my throat, and my brain throbbing in time
with it. I could not think, or argue with myself what was really
right and wise to do. I could only give myself up, and drift with
circumstances.</p>
<p>"A man has just come round the far corner," whispered Lisa. "Is
it Ivor? I can't make out. He doesn't look our way."</p>
<p>"Thank Heaven we're too far off for him to see our faces! I
would rather die than have Ivor know we're here," I broke out.</p>
<p>"I don't think it is Ivor," Lisa went on. "He's hidden himself
in the shadow, as if he were watching. It's <i>that</i> house he's
interested in. Who can he be, if not Ivor? A detective,
perhaps."</p>
<p>"Why should a detective watch Mademoiselle de Renzie's house?" I
asked, in spite of myself.</p>
<p>Lisa seemed a little confused, as if she had said something she
regretted.</p>
<p>"I don't know, I'm sure," she answered hastily. "Why, indeed? It
was just a thought. The man seems so anxious not to be seen.
Oh&mdash;keep back, Di, don't look out for an instant, till he's
passed. Ivor is coming now. He's walking in a great hurry. There!
he can't see you. He's far enough away for you to peep, and see for
yourself. He's at Maxine de Renzie's gate."</p>
<p>It was all over, then, and no more hope. His eyes when they gave
me that tragic look had lied, even as his lips had lied last night,
when he told me there was no other woman in his world but me.</p>
<p>"I won't look," I stammered, almost choking.</p>
<p>"Someone, I can't see who, is letting him in. The gate's shut
behind him."</p>
<p>"Let us go now," I begged.</p>
<p>"No, no, not yet!" cried Lisa. "I must know what happens next.
We are in the midst of it, indeed."</p>
<p>I hardly cared what she did, now. Ivor had come to see Maxine de
Renzie, and nothing else mattered very much. I had no strength to
insist that we should go.</p>
<p>"I wonder what the man in the shadow would do if he saw us?"
Lisa said. Then she leaned out, on the side away from the hiding
man, and softly told our chauffeur to go very slowly along the
street. This he did, but the man did not move.</p>
<p>"Stop before that house behind the wall with the creepers,"
directed Lisa, but I would not allow that.</p>
<p>"No, he shall not stop there!" I exclaimed. "Lisa, I forbid it.
You've had your way in everything so far. I won't let you have it
in this."</p>
<p>"Very well, we'll turn the corner into the next street, to
please you," said Lisa; and she gave orders to the chauffeur again.
"Now stop," she cried, when we had gone half way down the street,
out of sight and hearing of anyone in the Rue d'Hollande. Then, in
another instant, before I had any idea what she meant to do, she
was out of the cab, running like a child in the direction whence we
had come. I looked after her, hesitating whether or not to follow
(for I could not bear to risk meeting Ivor), and saw that she
paused at the corner. She was peeping into the Rue d'Hollande, to
find out what was happening there.</p>
<p>"She will come back in a moment or two," I said to myself
wearily, and sat waiting. For a little while she stood with her
long dress gathered up under her cloak: then she darted round the
corner and vanished. If she had not appeared again almost at once,
I should have had to tell the driver to follow, though I hated the
thought of going again into the street where Maxine de Renzie
lived. But she did come, and in her hand was a pretty little
brocade bag embroidered with gold or silver that sparkled even in
the faint light.</p>
<p>"I saw this lying in the street, and ran to pick it up," she
exclaimed.</p>
<p>"You might better have left it," I said stiffly. "Perhaps
Mademoiselle de Renzie dropped it."</p>
<p>"No, I don't think so. It wasn't in front of her house."</p>
<p>"It may belong to that man who was watching, then."</p>
<p>"It doesn't look much like a thing that a man would carry about
with him, does it?"</p>
<p>"No," I admitted, indifferently. "Now we will go home."</p>
<p>"Don't you want to wait and see how long Ivor Dundas stops?"</p>
<p>"Indeed I don't!" I cried. "I don't want to know any more about
him." And for the moment I almost believed that what I said was
true.</p>
<p>"Very well," said Lisa, "perhaps we do know enough to prove to
us both that I haven't anything to reproach myself with. And the
less you think about him after this, the better."</p>
<p>"I shan't think about him at all," I said. But I knew that was a
boast I should never be able to keep, try as I might. I felt now
that I could understand how people must feel when they are very old
and weary of life. I don't believe that I shall feel older and more
tired if I live to be eighty than I felt then. It was a slight
comfort to know that we were on our way back to the hotel, and that
soon I should be in my room alone, with the door shut and locked
between Lisa and me; but it was only very slight. I couldn't
imagine ever being really pleased about anything again.</p>
<p>"You will marry Lord Robert now, I suppose," chirped Lisa, "and
show Ivor Dundas that he hasn't spoiled your life."</p>
<p>As she asked this question she was tugging away at a knot in the
ribbons that tied the bag she had found.</p>
<p>"Perhaps I shall," I answered. "I might do worse."</p>
<p>"I should think you might!" exclaimed Lisa. "Oh, do accept him
soon. I don't want Ivor Dundas to say to himself that you're
broken-hearted for him. Lord Bob is sure to propose to you
to-morrow&mdash;even if he hasn't already: and if he has, he'll do
it again. I saw it in his eye all to-day. He was dying to speak at
any minute, if only he'd got a chance with you alone. You
<i>will</i> say 'yes' when he does, won't you, and have the
engagement announced at once?"</p>
<p>"I'll see how I feel at the time, if it comes," I answered,
trying to speak gaily, but making a failure of it.</p>
<p>At last Lisa had got the brocade bag open, and was looking in.
She seemed surprised by what she saw, and very much interested. She
put in her hand, and touched the thing, whatever it was; but she
did not tell me what was there. Probably she wanted to excite my
curiosity, and make me ask. But I didn't care enough to humour her.
If the bag had been stuffed full of the most gorgeous jewels in the
world, at that moment I shouldn't have been interested in the
least. I saw Lisa give a little sidelong peep up at me, to see if I
were watching; but when she found me looking entirely indifferent,
she tied up the bag again and stowed it away in one of the deep
pockets of her travelling cloak.</p>
<p>I was afraid that, when we'd arrived at the hotel and gone up to
our rooms Lisa might want to stop with me, and be vexed when I
turned her out, as I felt I must do. But she seemed to have lost
interest in me and my affairs, now that all doubt was settled. She
didn't even wish to talk over what had happened; but when I bade
her good-night, simply said, "good-night" in return, and let me
shut the door between the rooms.</p>
<p>"I suppose," I thought, "that the best thing I shall have to
hope for after this, until I grow quite old, is to sleep, and be
happy in my dreams." But though I tried hard to put away thoughts
of all kinds, and fall asleep, I couldn't. My eyes would not stay
closed for more than a minute at a time; and always I found myself
staring at the window, hour after hour, hoping for the light.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>DIANA HEARS NEWS</h3>
<p>It seemed as if the night would never end. If I had been vain,
and deserved to be punished for my vanity, then I was well punished
now; I felt so ashamed and humiliated.</p>
<p>It must have been long after one when I went to bed, yet I was
thankful when dawn came, and gave me an excuse to get up. After I
had had a cold bath, however, I felt better, and a cup of steaming
hot coffee afterwards did me good. I was all dressed when Morton,
Aunt Lilian's maid, knocked at my door to ask if I were up, and if
she could help me do my hair. "Her Ladyship" sent me her love, and
hoped I had rested nicely. She would be pleased to hear that I was
looking well.</p>
<p>Looking well! I was glad to know that, though it surprised me. I
stared at myself in the glass, and wondered that so many hours of
misery had made so little impression on my face. I was rather paler
than usual, perhaps, but my cheeks were faintly pink, and my lips
red. I suppose while one is young one can suffer a good deal and
one's face tell no secret.</p>
<p>We were to make a very early start to examine the wonderful
motor-car which Lord Robert West had advised Aunt Lil to buy.
Afterwards she and Lisa and I had planned to do a little shopping,
because it would seem a waste of time to be in Paris and bring
nothing away from the shops. But when I tapped at Lisa's door
(dreading, yet wishing, to have our first greeting over), it
appeared that she had a bad headache and did not want to go with us
to see the Rajah's automobile. While I was with her Aunt Lil came
in, looking very bright and handsome.</p>
<p>She was "so sorry" for Lisa, and not at all sorry for me (how
little she guessed!); and before taking me away with her, promised
to come back after it was settled about the car, to see whether
Lisa were well enough by that time for the shopping expedition.</p>
<p>The automobile really was a "magnificent animal," as Aunt Lil
said, and it took her just two minutes, after examining it from
bonnet to tool-boxes, to make up her mind that she could not be
happy without it. It was sixty horsepower, and of a world-renowned
make; but that was a detail. <i>Any</i> car could be powerful and
well made; every car should be, or you would not pay for it; but
she had never seen one before with such heavenly little
arrangements for luggage and lunch; while as for the gold toilet
things, in a pale grey su&egrave;de case, they were beyond words,
and she must have them&mdash;the motor also, of course, since it
went with them.</p>
<p>So that was decided; and she and I drove back to the hotel,
while the two men went to the Automobile Club, of which Lord Bob
was an honorary member.</p>
<p>If possible, all formalities were to be got through with the
Rajah's agent and the car paid for. At two o'clock, when we were to
meet the men at the Ritz for luncheon, they were to let us know
whether everything had been successfully arranged: and, if so, Aunt
Lil wanted the party to motor to Calais in her new automobile,
instead of going by train. Lord Bob would drive, but he meant to
hire a chauffeur recommended by the Club, so that he would not have
to stop behind and see to getting the car across the Channel in a
cargo boat.</p>
<p>Aunt Lil was very much excited over this idea, as she always is
over anything new, and if I was rather quiet and uninterested, she
was too much occupied to notice.</p>
<p>Lisa was looking worse when we went back to her at the hotel,
but Aunt Lil didn't notice that either. She is always nice to Lisa,
but she doesn't like her, and it is only when you really care for
people that you observe changes in them when you are busy thinking
of your own affairs.</p>
<p>I advised Lisa to rest in her own room, instead of shopping, as
she would have the long motor run later in the day, and a night
journey; but she was dressed and seemed to want to go out. She had
things to do, she said, and though she didn't buy anything when she
was with us, while we were at a milliner's in the Rue de la Paix
choosing hats for Aunt Lil, she disappeared on some errand of her
own, and only came back just as we were ready to leave the shop.
Whatever it was that she had been doing, it had interested her and
waked her out of herself, for her eyes looked brighter and she had
spots of colour on her cheeks.</p>
<p>Aunt Lil found so much to do, and was sure we could easily carry
so many things in the motor-car, that it was a rush to meet Uncle
Eric and Lord Bob at the Ritz, by two o'clock. But we did manage
it, or nearly. We were not more than ten minutes late, which was
wonderful for Aunt Lil: and the short time that we'd kept them
waiting wasn't enough to account for the solemnity of the two men's
faces as they came forward to meet us.</p>
<p>"Something's gone wrong about the car!" exclaimed Aunt Lil.</p>
<p>"No, the car's all right," said Lord Bob. "I've got you a
chauffeur too, and&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Then what has happened? You both look like thunder-clouds, or
wet blankets, or something disagreeable. It surely can't be because
you're hungry that you're cross about a few minutes."</p>
<p>"Have you seen a newspaper to-day?" asked Uncle Eric.</p>
<p>"A newspaper? I should think not, indeed; we've had too many
important things to do to waste time on trifles. Why, has the
Government gone out?"</p>
<p>"Ivor Dundas has got into a mess here," Uncle Eric answered,
looking very much worried&mdash;so much worried that I thought he
must care even more about Ivor than I had fancied.</p>
<p>"Of course it's the most awful rot," said Lord Bob, "but he's
accused of murder."</p>
<p>"It's in the evening papers: not a word had got into the morning
ones," Uncle Eric went on. "We've only just seen the news since we
came here to wait for you; otherwise I should have tried to do
something for him. As it is, of course I must, as a friend of his,
stop in Paris and do what I can to help him through. But that
needn't keep the rest of you from going on to-day as you
planned."</p>
<p>"What an awful thing!" exclaimed Aunt Lil. "I will stay too, if
the girls don't mind. Poor fellow! It may be some comfort to him to
feel that he has friends on the spot, standing by him. I've got
thousands of engagements&mdash;we all have&mdash;but I shall
telegraph to everybody. What about you, Lord Bob?"</p>
<p>"I'll stand by, with you, Lady Mountstuart," said he, his nice
though not very clever face more anxious-looking than I had ever
seen it, his blue, wide-apart eyes watching me rather wistfully.
"Dundas and I have never been intimate, but he's a fine chap, and
I've always admired him. He's sure to come out of this all
right."</p>
<p>Poor Lord Robert! I hadn't much thought to give him then; but
dimly I felt that his anxiety was concerned with me even more than
with Ivor, of whom he spoke so kindly, though he had often shown
signs of jealousy in past days.</p>
<p>I felt stunned, and almost dazed. If anyone had spoken to me, I
think I should have been dumb, unable to answer; but nobody did
speak, or seem to think it strange that I had nothing to say.</p>
<p>"I suppose you won't try to do anything until after lunch, will
you, Mountstuart?" Lord Robert went on to ask.</p>
<p>"No, we must eat, and talk things over," said Uncle Eric.</p>
<p>We went into the restaurant, I moving as if I were in a dream.
Ivor accused of murder! What had he done? What could have
happened?</p>
<p>But I was soon to know. As soon as we were seated at a table,
where the lovely, fresh flowers seemed a mockery, Aunt Lil began
asking questions.</p>
<p>For some reason, Uncle Eric apparently did not like answering.
It was almost as if he had had some kind of previous knowledge of
the affair, of which he didn't wish to speak. But, I suppose, it
could not have been that.</p>
<p>It was Lord Robert who told us nearly everything; and always I
was conscious that he was watching me, wondering if this were a
cruel blow for me, asking himself if he were speaking in a tactful
way of one who had been his rival.</p>
<p>"There was that engagement of Dundas' last night, which he was
just going to keep when we saw him," said Lord Bob, carefully, but
clumsily. "I'm afraid there must have been something fishy about
that&mdash;I mean, some trap must have been laid to catch him. And,
it seems, he wasn't supposed to be in Paris&mdash;though I don't
see what that can have to do with the plot, if there is one. He was
stopping in the hotel under another name. No doubt he had some good
reason, though. There's nothing sly about Dundas. If ever there was
a plucky chap, he's one. Anyhow, apparently, he wanted to get hold
of a man in Paris he couldn't find, for he called last evening on a
detective named Girard, a rather well-known fellow in his line, I
believe. It almost looks as if Dundas had made an enemy of him, for
he's been giving evidence pretty freely to the police&mdash;lost no
time about it, anyhow. Girard says he was following up the scent,
tracking down the person he'd been hired by Dundas to hunt for, and
had at last come to the house where he was lodging, when there he
found Dundas himself, ransacking the room, covered with blood, and
the chap who was wanted, lying dead on the floor, his body hardly
cold."</p>
<p>"What time was all that?" enquired Lisa sharply. It was the
first question she had asked.</p>
<p>"Between midnight and one o'clock, I think the papers said,"
answered Lord Bob.</p>
<p>"Well, of course it's all nonsense," exclaimed Aunt Lil
impatiently. "French people are so sensational, and they jump at
conclusions so. The idea of their daring to accuse a man like Ivor
Dundas of murder! They ought to know better. They'll soon be eating
humble-pie, and begging England's pardon for wrongful treatment of
a British subject, won't they, Eric?"</p>
<p>"I'm afraid there's no question of jumping at conclusions on the
part of the authorities, or of eating humble-pie," Uncle Eric said.
"The evidence&mdash;entirely circumstantial so far,
luckily&mdash;is dead against Ivor. And as for his being a British
subject, there's nothing in that. If an Englishman chooses to
commit a murder in France, he's left to the French law to deal
with, as if he were a Frenchman."</p>
<p>"But Ivor hasn't committed murder!" cried Aunt Lilian,
horrified.</p>
<p>"Of course not. But he's got to prove that he hasn't. And in
that he's worse off than if this thing happened in England. English
law supposes a man innocent until he's been proved guilty. French
law, on the contrary, presumes that he's guilty until he's proved
innocent. In face of the evidence against Ivor, the authorities
couldn't have done otherwise than they have done."</p>
<p>For the first time in my life I felt angry with Aunt Lilian's
husband. I do hate that cold, stern "sense of justice" on which men
pride themselves so much, whether it's an affair of a friend or an
enemy!</p>
<p>"Surely Mr. Dundas must have been able to prove
an&mdash;an&mdash;don't you call it an alibi?" asked Lisa.</p>
<p>"He didn't try to," replied Lord Bob. "He's simply refused, up
to the present, to tell what he was doing between twelve o'clock
and the time he was found, except to say that he walked for a good
while before going to the house where Girard afterwards found him.
Of course he denies killing the man: says the fellow had stolen
something from him, on the boat crossing from Dover to Calais
yesterday, and that after applying to the detective, he got a note
from the thief, offering to give the thing back if he would call
and name a reward. Says he found the room already ransacked and the
fellow dead, when he arrived at the address given him; that he was
searching for his property when Girard appeared on the scene."</p>
<p>"Couldn't he have shown the note sent by the thief?" asked Aunt
Lil.</p>
<p>"He did show a note. But it does him more harm than good. And he
wouldn't tell what the thing was the thief had taken from him,
except that it was valuable. It does look as if he were determined
to make the case as black as possible against himself; but then, as
I said before, no doubt he has good reasons."</p>
<p>"He has no good luck, anyhow!" sighed Aunt Lil, who always liked
Ivor.</p>
<p>"Rather not&mdash;so far. Why, one of the worst bits of evidence
against him is that the concierge of this house in the Rue de la
Fille Sauvage swears that though Dundas hadn't been in the place
much above half an hour when the detective arrived, he was there
then <i>for the second time</i>, that he admitted it when he came.
The first visit he made, according to the concierge, was about an
hour before the second: the concierge was already in bed in his
little box, but not asleep, when a man rang and an English-sounding
voice asked for Monsieur Gestre. On hearing that Gestre was away,
the visitor said he would see the gentleman who was stopping in
Gestre's room. By and by the Englishman went out, and on being
challenged, said he might come back again later. After a while the
concierge was waked up once more by a caller for Gestre, who
announced that he'd been before; and now he vows that it was the
same man both times, though Dundas denies having called twice. If
he could prove that he'd been in the house no more than half an
hour, it might be all right, for two doctors agree that the
murdered man had been dead more than an hour when they were called
in. But he can't or won't prove it&mdash;that's his luck
again!&mdash;and nobody can be found who saw him in any of the
streets through which he mentions passing. The last moment that he
can be accounted for is when a cabman, who'd taken him up at the
hotel just after he left us, set him down in the Rue de Courbvoie,
not so very far from the &Eacute;lys&eacute;e Palace. Then it was
only between five and ten minutes past twelve, so he could easily
have gone on to the Rue de la Fille Sauvage afterwards and killed
his man at the time when the doctors say the fellow must have died.
It's a bad scrape. But of course Dundas will get out of it somehow
or other, in the end."</p>
<p>"Do <i>you</i> think he will, Eric?" asked Aunt Lil.</p>
<p>"I hope so with all my heart," he answered. But his face showed
that he was deeply troubled, and my heart sank down&mdash;down.</p>
<p>As I realised more and more the danger in which Ivor stood, my
resentment against him began to seem curiously trivial. Nothing had
happened to make me feel that I had done him an injustice in
thinking he cared more for Maxine de Renzie than for
me&mdash;indeed, on the contrary, everything went to prove his
supreme loyalty to her whose name he had refused to speak, even for
the sake of clearing himself. Still, now that the world was against
him, my soul rushed to stand by his side, to defend him, to give
him love and trust in spite of all.</p>
<p>Down deep in my heart I forgave him, even though he had been
cruel, and I yearned over him with an exceeding tenderness. More
than anything on earth, I wanted to help him; and I meant to try.
Indeed, as the talk went on while that terrible meal progressed, I
thought I saw a way to do it, if Lisa and I should act
together.</p>
<p>I was so anxious to have a talk with her that I could hardly
wait to get back to our own hotel, from the Ritz. Fortunately,
nobody wanted to sit long at lunch, so it wasn't yet three when I
called her into my room. The men had gone to make different
arrangements about starting, for we were not to leave Paris until
they had had time to do something for Ivor. Uncle Eric went to see
the British Ambassador, and Aunt Lilian had said that she would be
busy for at least an hour, writing letters and telegrams to cancel
engagements we had had in London. For awhile Lisa and I were almost
sure not to be interrupted; but I spoke out abruptly what was in my
mind, not wishing to lose a minute.</p>
<p>"I think the only thing for us to do," I said, "is to tell what
we know, and save Ivor in spite of himself."</p>
<p>"How can anything you know save him?" she asked, with a queer,
faint emphasis which I didn't understand.</p>
<p>"Don't you see," I cried, "that if we come forward and say we
saw him in the Rue d'Hollande at a quarter past twelve&mdash;going
into a house there&mdash;he couldn't have murdered the man in that
other house, far away. It all hangs on the time."</p>
<p>"But you didn't see him go in," Lisa contradicted me.</p>
<p>I stared at her. "<i>You</i> did. Isn't it the same thing?"</p>
<p>"No, not unless I choose to say so."</p>
<p>"And&mdash;but you will choose. You want to save him, of
course."</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>"Because he's innocent. Because he's your friend."</p>
<p>"No man is the friend of any woman, if he's in love with
another."</p>
<p>"Oh, Lisa, does sophistry of that sort matter? Does anything
matter except saving him?"</p>
<p>"I don't consider," she said, in a slow, aggravating way, "that
Ivor Dundas has behaved very well to&mdash;to our family. But I
want you to understand this, Di. If he is to be got out of this
danger&mdash;no doubt it's real danger&mdash;in any such way as you
propose, it's for <i>me</i> to do it, not you. He'll have to owe
his gratitude to me. And there's something else I can do for him,
perhaps&mdash;I, and only I. A thing of value was stolen from him,
it seems, a thing he was anxious to get back at any
price&mdash;even the price of looking for it on a dead man's body.
Well, I think I know what that thing was&mdash;I think I have
it."</p>
<p>"What do you mean?" I asked, astonished at her and at her
manner&mdash;and her words.</p>
<p>"I'm not going to tell you what I mean. Only I'm sure of what
I'm saying&mdash;at least, that the thing <i>is</i> valuable, worth
risking a great deal for. I learned that from experts this morning,
while you and your aunt were thinking about hats."</p>
<p>For an instant I was completely bewildered. Then, suddenly, a
strange idea sprang into my mind:</p>
<p>"That brocade bag you picked up in the Rue d'Hollande last
night!"</p>
<p>It was the first time I had thought of it from that moment to
this&mdash;there had been so many other things which seemed more
important.</p>
<p>Lisa looked annoyed. I think she had counted on my not
remembering, or not connecting her hints with the thing she had
found in the street, and that she had wanted to tantalise me.</p>
<p>"I won't say whether I mean the brocade bag or not, and whether,
if I do, that I believe Ivor dropped it, or whether there was
another man mixed up in the case&mdash;perhaps the real murderer.
If I <i>do</i> decide to tell what I know and what I suspect, it
won't be to you&mdash;unless for a very particular reason&mdash;and
it won't be yet awhile."</p>
<p>I'm afraid that I almost hated her for a moment, she seemed so
cold, so calculating and sly. I couldn't bear to think that she was
my step-sister, and I was glad that, at least, not a drop of the
same blood ran in our veins.</p>
<p>"If you choose to keep silent for some purpose of your own," I
broke out, "you can't prevent me from telling the whole story, as
<i>I</i> know it&mdash;how I went out with you, and all that."</p>
<p>"I can't prevent you from doing it, but I can advise you not
to&mdash;for Ivor's sake," she answered.</p>
<p>"For his sake?"</p>
<p>"Yes, and for your own, too, if you care for his opinion of you
at all. For his sake, because <i>neither</i> of us knows when he
came out of Maxine de Renzie's house. You <i>would</i> go away,
though I wanted to stay and watch. He may not have been there more
than five minutes for all we can tell to the contrary, in which
case he would still have had time to go straight off to the Rue de
la Fille Sauvage and kill that man, in accordance with the doctors'
statements about the death. For <i>your</i> sake, because if he
knows that you tracked him to Maxine de Renzie's house, he won't
respect you very much; and because he would probably be furious
with you, unable to forgive you as long as he lived, for injuring
the reputation of the woman he's risked so much to save. He'd
believe you did it out of spiteful jealousy against her."</p>
<p>I grew cold all over, and trembled so that I could hardly
speak.</p>
<p>"Ivor would know that I'm incapable of such baseness."</p>
<p>"I'm not sure he'd hold you above it. 'Hell hath no fury like a
woman scorned'&mdash;and he <i>has</i> scorned you&mdash;for an
actress."</p>
<p>It was as if she had struck me in the face: and I could feel the
blood rush up to my cheeks. They burned so hotly that the tears
were forced to my eyes.</p>
<p>"You see I'm right, don't you?" Lisa asked.</p>
<p>"You may be right in thinking I could do him no good in that
way&mdash;and that he wouldn't wish it, even if I could. But not
about the rest," I said. "We won't talk of it any more. I can't
stand it. Please go back to your room now, Lisa, I want to be
alone."</p>
<p>"Very well," she snapped, "<i>you</i> called me in. I didn't ask
to come."</p>
<p>Then she went out, with not another word or look, and slammed
the door. I could imagine myself compelling her to give up the
brocade bag, or offering her some great bribe of money, thousands
of pounds, if necessary. Lisa is a strange little creature. She
will do a good deal for money.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>DIANA UNDERTAKES A STRANGE ERRAND</h3>
<p>If I had not been tingling with anger against Lisa, who had
seemed to enjoy saying needlessly cruel things to me, perhaps I
would have been utterly discouraged when she pricked the bubble of
my hope. She had made me realise that the plan I had was useless,
perhaps worse than useless; but in my desperate mood I caught at
another. I would try to see Ivor, and find out some other way of
helping him. At all events he should know that I was for him, not
against him, in this time of trouble.</p>
<p>Perhaps this new idea was a mad one, I told myself. Perhaps I
should not be allowed to see him, even in the presence of others.
But while there was a "perhaps" I wouldn't give up. Without waiting
for a cooler or more cowardly mood to set in, I almost ran out of
my room, and downstairs, for I hadn't taken off my hat and coat
since coming in.</p>
<p>I had no knowledge of French law, or police etiquette, or
anything of that sort. But I knew the French as a gallant nation;
and I thought that if a girl should go to the right place begging
for a short conversation with an accused man, as his friend, an
interview&mdash;probably with a witness&mdash;might possibly be
granted. The authorities might think that we were engaged, for all
I cared. I did not care about anything now, except seeing Ivor, and
helping him if I could.</p>
<p>I hardly knew what I meant to do at the beginning, by way of
getting the chance I wanted, until I had asked to have a motor-cab
called for me. Then, I suddenly thought of the British Ambassador,
a great friend of Uncle Eric's and Aunt Lilian's. Uncle Eric had
already been to him, but I fancied not with a view of trying to see
Ivor. That idea had apparently not been in his mind at all. Anyway,
the Ambassador would already understand that the family took a deep
interest in the fate of Ivor Dundas, and would not be wholly
astonished at receiving a call from me. Besides, hearing of some
rather venturesome escapades of mine when I first arrived in
London, he had once, while visiting Uncle Eric, laughed a good deal
and said that in future he would be "surprised at nothing an
American girl might do."</p>
<p>I told the driver to go to the British Embassy as fast as he
could. There, I sent in my name, and the Ambassador received me at
once. I didn't explain much, but came to the point immediately, and
said that I wanted&mdash;oh, but wanted and needed very much
indeed&mdash;to see Ivor Dundas. Could he, would he help me to do
that?</p>
<p>"Ought I to help you?" he asked. "Would Mountstuart and Lady
Mountstuart approve?"</p>
<p>"Yes," I said firmly. "They would approve. You see, it is
necessary."</p>
<p>"Then, if it's necessary&mdash;and I believe you when you say
that it is," he answered, "I'll do what I can."</p>
<p>What he could do and did do, was to write a personal letter to
the Chief of Police in Paris, asking as a favour that his friend,
Miss Forrest, a young lady related through marriage to the British
Foreign Secretary, should be allowed five minutes' conversation
with the Englishman accused of murder, Mr. Ivor Dundas.</p>
<p>I took the letter to the Chief of Police myself, to save time,
and because I was so restless and excited that I must be doing
something every instant&mdash;something which I felt might bring me
nearer to Ivor.</p>
<p>From the Chief of Police, who proved to be a most courteous
person, I received an order to give to the governor of the gaol or
prison where they had put Ivor. This, he explained, would procure
me the interview I wanted, but unfortunately, I must not hope to
see my friend alone. A warder who understood English would have to
be present.</p>
<p>So far I had gone into the wild venture without once thinking
what it would be to find myself suddenly face to face with Ivor in
such terrible circumstances, or what he would think of me for
coming in such a way now that we were no longer anything to each
other&mdash;not even friends. But a kind of ague-terror crept over
me while I sat waiting in an ugly little bare, stuffy reception
room. My head was going round and round, my heart was pounding so
that I could not make up my mind what to say to Ivor when he
came.</p>
<p>Then, suddenly, I heard the sound of footsteps outside the door;
and when it opened, there stood Ivor, between two Frenchmen in blue
uniforms. One of them walked into the room with him&mdash;I suppose
he must have been a warder&mdash;but he stopped near the door, and
in a second I had forgotten all about him. He simply ceased to
exist for me, when my eyes and Ivor's had met.</p>
<p>I sprang up from my chair and began to talk as quickly as I
could, stammering and confused, hardly knowing what I said, but
anxious to make him understand in the beginning that I had not come
to take back my words of yesterday.</p>
<p>"We're all so dreadfully sorry, Mr. Dundas," I said. "I don't
know if Uncle Eric has been here yet&mdash;but he is doing all he
can, and Aunt Lilian is dreadfully upset. We're staying on in Paris
on account of&mdash;on account of this. So you see you've got
friends near you. And I&mdash;we're such old friends, I couldn't
help trying as hard as I could for a sight of you to&mdash;to cheer
you up, and&mdash;and to help you, if that's possible."</p>
<p>I spoke very fast, not daring to look at him after the first,
but pretending to smooth out some wrinkles in one of my long
gloves. My eyes were full of tears, and I was afraid they'd go
splashing down my cheeks, if I even winked my lashes. I loved him
more than ever now, and felt capable of forgiving him anything, if
only I had the chance to forgive, and if only, <i>only</i> he
really loved me and not that other.</p>
<p>"Thank you, a hundred times&mdash;more than I can express," he
said, with a faint quiver in his voice&mdash;his beautiful voice,
which was the first thing that charmed me after knowing him. "It
<i>does</i> cheer me to see you. It gives me strength and courage.
You wouldn't have come if you didn't&mdash;trust me, and believe me
innocent."</p>
<p>"Why, of course, I&mdash;we&mdash;believe you innocent of any
crime," I faltered.</p>
<p>"And of any lack of faith?"</p>
<p>"Oh, as for that, how can&mdash;but don't let's speak of that.
What can it matter now?"</p>
<p>"It matters more than anything else in the world. If only you
could say that you will have faith!"</p>
<p>"I'll try to say it then, if it can give you any comfort."</p>
<p>"Not unless you mean it."</p>
<p>"Then&mdash;I'll try to mean it. Will that satisfy you?"</p>
<p>"It's better than nothing. And I thank you again. As for the
rest, you're not to be anxious. Everything will come right for me
sooner or later, though I may have to suffer some annoyances
first."</p>
<p>"Annoyances?" I echoed. "If there were nothing worse!"</p>
<p>"There won't be. I shall be well defended. It will all be shown
up as a huge mistake&mdash;another warning against trusting to
circumstantial evidence."</p>
<p>"Is there nothing we can do then? Or&mdash;that we would urge
<i>others</i> to do?" I asked, hoping he would understand that I
meant <i>one</i> other&mdash;Maxine de Renzie.</p>
<p>I guessed by his look that he did understand. It was a look of
gloom; but suddenly a light flashed in his eyes.</p>
<p>"There is one thing <i>you</i> could do for me&mdash;you and no
one else," he said. "But I have no right to ask it."</p>
<p>"Tell me what it is," I implored.</p>
<p>"I would not, if it didn't mean more than my life to me." He
hesitated, and then, while I wondered what was to come, he bent
forward and spoke a few hurried words in Spanish. He knew that to
me Spanish was almost as familiar as English. He had heard me talk
of the Spanish customs still existing in the part of California
where I was born. He had heard me sing Spanish songs. We had sung
them together&mdash;one or two I had taught him. But I had not
taught him the language. He learned that, and three or four others
at least, as a boy, when first he thought of taking up a diplomatic
career.</p>
<p>They were so few words, and so quickly spoken, that
I&mdash;remembering the warder&mdash;almost hoped they might pass
unnoticed. But the man in uniform came nearer to us at once,
looking angry and suspicious.</p>
<p>"That is forbidden," he said to Ivor. Then, turning sharply to
me. "What language was that?"</p>
<p>"Spanish," I answered. "He only bade me good-bye. We have
been&mdash;very dear friends, and there was a misunderstanding,
but&mdash;it's over now. It was natural he shouldn't want you to
hear his last words to me."</p>
<p>"Nevertheless, it is forbidden," repeated the warder
obstinately, "and though the five minutes you were granted together
are not over yet, the prisoner must go with me now. He has
forfeited the rest of his time, and must be reported."</p>
<p>With this, he ordered Ivor to leave the room, in a tone which
sounded to me so brutal that I should have liked him to be shot,
and the whole French police force exterminated. To hear a little
underbred policeman dare to speak like that to my big, brave,
handsome Englishman, and to know that it would be childish and
undignified of Ivor to resist&mdash;oh, I could have killed the
creature with my own hands&mdash;I think!</p>
<p>As for Ivor, he said not another word, except "good-bye,"
smiling half sadly, half with a twinkle of grim humour. Then he
went out, with his head high: and just at the door he threw me back
one look. It said as plainly as if he had spoken: "Remember, I know
you won't fail me."</p>
<p>I did indeed remember, and I prayed that I should have pluck and
courage not to fail. But it was a very hard thing that he had asked
me to do, and he had said well in saying that he would not ask it
of me if it did not mean more than his life.</p>
<p>The words he had whispered so hastily and unexpectedly in
Spanish, were these: "Go to the room of the murder alone, and on
the window balcony find in a box under flower-pots a folded
document. Take this to Maxine. Every moment counts."</p>
<p>So it seemed that it was always of her he thought&mdash;of
Maxine de Renzie! And I, of all people in the world, was to help
him, with her.</p>
<p>As I thought of this task he'd set me, and of all it meant, it
appeared more and more incredible that he should have had the heart
to ask such a thing of me. But&mdash;it "meant more than his life."
And I would do the thing, if it could be done, because of my
pride.</p>
<p>As I drove away from the prison a kind of fury grew in me and
possessed me. I felt as if I had fire instead of blood in my veins.
If I had known that death, or worse than death, waited for me in
the ghastly house to which Ivor had sent me, I would still have
gone there.</p>
<p>My first thought was to go instantly, and get it over&mdash;with
success or failure. But calmer thoughts prevailed.</p>
<p>I hadn't looked at the papers yet. My only knowledge of last
night's dreadful happenings had come from Uncle Eric and Lord
Robert West. I had said to myself that I didn't wish to read the
newspaper accounts of the murder, and of Ivor's supposed part in
it. I remembered now, however, that I did not even know in what
part of Paris the house of the murder was. I recalled only the name
of the street, because it was a curiously grim one&mdash;like the
tragedy that had been acted in it.</p>
<p>I couldn't tell the chaffeur to drive me to the street and
house. That would be a stupid thing to do. I must search the
papers, and find out from them something about the neighbourhood,
for there would surely be plenty of details of that sort. And I
must do this without first going back to the hotel, as it might be
very difficult to get away again, once I was there. Now, nobody
knew where I was, and I was free to do as I pleased, no matter what
the consequences might be afterwards.</p>
<p>Passing a Duval restaurant, I suddenly ordered my motor-cab to
stop. Having paid, and sent it away, I went upstairs and asked for
a cup of chocolate at one of the little, deadly respectable-looking
marble tables. Also I asked to see an evening paper.</p>
<p>It was a shock to find Ivor's photograph, horribly reproduced,
gazing at me from the front page. The photograph was an old one,
which had been a good deal shown in shop windows, much to Ivor's
disgust, at about the time when he returned from his great
expedition and published his really wonderful book. I had seen it
before I met him, and as it must have been on sale in Paris as well
as London, it had been easy enough for the newspaper people to get
it. Then there came the story of the murder, built up dramatically.
Hating it, sickened by it, I yet read it all. I knew where to go to
find the house, and I knew that the murder had been committed in a
back room on the top floor. Also I saw the picture of the window
with the balcony. Ivor was supposed&mdash;according to Girard, the
detective&mdash;to have tried in vain to escape by way of this high
balcony, on hearing sounds outside the door while busy in searching
the dead man's room. Girard said that he had seen him first, by the
light of a bull's-eye lantern, which he&mdash;Girard&mdash;carried,
standing at bay in the open window. There was a photograph of this
window, taken from outside. There was the balcony: and there was
the balcony of another window with another balcony just like it, on
the adjoining house. I looked at the picture, and judged that there
would not be more than two feet of distance between the railings of
those two balconies.</p>
<p>"That would be my way to get there&mdash;if I can get there at
all," I said to myself. But there was hardly any "if" left in my
mind now. I meant to get there.</p>
<p>By this time it was after five o'clock. I left the Duval
restaurant, and again took a cab. The first thing I did was to send
a <i>petit bleu</i> to Aunt Lilian, saying that she wasn't to worry
about me. I'd been hipped and nervous, and had gone out to see a
friend who was&mdash;I'd just found out&mdash;staying in Paris.
Perhaps I should stop with the friend to dinner; but at latest I
should be back by nine or ten o'clock. That would save a bother at
the hotel (for Aunt Lilian knew I had heaps of American friends who
came every year to Paris), yet no one would know where to search
for me, even if they were inclined.</p>
<p>Next, I drove to a street near the Rue de la Fille Sauvage, and
dismissed my cab. I asked for no directions, but after one or two
mistakes, found the street I wanted. Instead of going to the house
of the murder, I passed on to the next house on the left&mdash;the
house of the balcony almost adjoining the dead man's.</p>
<p>I rang the bell for the concierge, and asked him if there were
any rooms to let in the house. I knew already that there were, for
I could see the advertisement of "<i>Chambres &agrave; louer</i>"
staring me in the face: but I spoke French as badly as I could,
making three mistakes to every sentence, and begged the man to talk
slowly in answering me.</p>
<p>There were several rooms to be had, it appeared, but it would
have been too good to be true that the one I wanted should be
empty. After we had jabbered awhile, I made the concierge
understand that I was a young American journalist, employed by a
New York paper. I wanted to "write up" the murder of last night,
according to my own ideas, and as of course the police wouldn't let
me go into the room where it happened, the next best thing would be
to take the room close to it, in the house adjoining. I wanted to
be there only long enough to "get the emotion, the sensation," I
explained, so as to make my article really dramatic. Would the
people who occupied that room let it to me for a few hours? Long
before bedtime they could have it back again, if I got on well with
my writing.</p>
<p>The concierge, to whom I gave ten francs as a kind of retaining
fee, was almost sure the occupants of the room (an old man and his
wife) would willingly agree to such a proposal, if I paid them well
enough for their trouble in turning out.</p>
<p>Would three louis be enough? I asked. The concierge&mdash;whose
eyes brightened&mdash;thought that it would. I knew by his look
that he would take a large commission for managing the affair, as
he quickly offered to do; but that didn't matter to me.</p>
<p>He confirmed my idea that it would have been hopeless to try and
get into the room of the murder itself, even if I could have borne
it, saying that the door, and window too, had been sealed by the
police, who were also guarding the house from curiosity seekers;
but he added that I could see the shut window from the balcony of
the room I was going to hire.</p>
<p>I waited for him, and played with his very unattractive baby
while he went upstairs to make enquiries. He was gone for some
time, explaining to the people; but at last, when my patience was
almost too far strained, he came back to say that Monsieur and
Madame Nissot had consented to go out of their room for the
evening. They were dining at the moment, however, and Mademoiselle
must be pleased to wait a few moments until they finished the meal
and gathered up a few things which they could carry to a
neighbour's: books, and work for their hours of absence, the
concierge politely suggested. But that was to save my feelings, no
doubt, for I was sure the husband and wife meant to make a parcel
of any valuables which could possibly be carried off by an
unscrupulous American journalist. Also, they stipulated that
payment must be made in advance. To this I agreed willingly. And
then&mdash;I waited, waited. It was tedious, but after all, the
tediousness didn't matter much when I came to think of it. It would
be impossible to do the thing I had made up my mind to do, till
after dark.</p>

<h2>MAXINE DE RENZIE'S PART</h2>
<a name="2HCH17"><!-- H2 anchor --></a>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>MAXINE MAKES A BARGAIN</h3>
<p>We looked everywhere, in all possible places, for the diamond
necklace, Raoul and I; and to him, poor fellow, its second loss
seemed overwhelming. He did not see in glaring scarlet letters
always before his eyes these two words: "The treaty," as I
did&mdash;for my punishment. He was in happy ignorance still of
that other loss which I&mdash;I, to whom his honour should have
been sacred&mdash;had inflicted upon him. He was satisfied with my
story; that through a person employed by me&mdash;a person whose
name could not yet be mentioned, even to him&mdash;the necklace had
been snatched from the thief who had stolen it. He blamed himself
mercilessly for thinking so little of the brocade bag which I had
given him at parting, for letting all remembrance of my words
concerning it be put out of his mind by his "wicked jealousy," as
he repentantly called it. For me, he had nothing but praise and
gratitude for what I had done for him. He begged me to forgive him,
and his remorse for such a small thing, comparatively&mdash;wrung
my heart.</p>
<p>We searched the garden and the whole street, then came back to
search the little drawing-room for the second time, in vain. It did
seem that there was witchcraft in it, as I said to Raoul; but at
last I persuaded him to go away, and follow his own track wherever
he had been since I gave him the bag with the diamonds. It was just
possible, as it was so late, and his way had led him through quiet
streets, that even after all this time the little brocade bag might
be lying where he had left it&mdash;or that some honest policeman
on his beat might have picked it up. Besides, there was the cab in
which he had come part of the distance to my house. The bag might
have fallen on the floor while he drove: and there were many honest
cabmen in Paris, I reminded him, trying to be as cheerful as I
could.</p>
<p>So he left me. And I was deadly tired; but I had no thought of
sleep&mdash;no wish for it. When I had unlocked the door of my
boudoir and found Ivor Dundas gone, as I had hoped he would be, the
next hope born in my heart was that he might by and by come back,
or send&mdash;with news. Hour after hour of deadly suspense passed
on, and he did not come or make any sign. At five o'clock Marianne,
who had flitted about all night like a restless ghost, made me
drink a cup of hot chocolate, and actually put me to bed. My last
words to her were: "What is the use? I can't sleep. It will be
worse to lie and toss in a fever, than sit up."</p>
<p>Yet I did sleep, and heavily. She will always deny it, I know,
but I'm sure she must have slyly slipped a sleeping-powder into the
chocolate. I was far too much occupied with my own thoughts, as I
drank to please her, to think whether or no there was anything at
all peculiar in the taste.</p>
<p>Be that as it may, I slept; and when I waked suddenly, starting
out of a hateful dream (yet scarcely worse than realities), to my
horror it was nearly noon.</p>
<p>I was wild with fear lest the servants, in their stupid but
well-meant wish not to disturb me, might have sent important
visitors away. However, when Marianne came flying in, in answer to
my long peal of the electric bell, she said that no one had been.
There were letters and one telegram, and all the morning papers, as
usual after the first night of a new play.</p>
<p>My heart gave a spring at the news that there was a telegram,
for I thought it might be from Ivor, saying he was on the track of
the treaty, even if he hadn't yet got hold of it. But the message
was from Raoul; and he had not found the brocade bag. He did not
put this in so many words, but said, "I have not found what was
lost, or learned anything of it."</p>
<p>From Ivor there was not a line, and I thought this cruel. He
might have wired, or written me a note, even if there were nothing
definite to say. He might, unless&mdash;something had happened to
him. There was that to think of; and I did think of it, with dread,
and a growing presentiment that I had not suffered yet all I was to
suffer. I determined to send a servant to the &Eacute;lys&eacute;e
Palace Hotel to enquire for him, and despatched Henri immediately.
Meanwhile, as there was nothing to do, after pretending to eat
breakfast under the watchful eyes of Marianne, I pretended also to
read the newspaper notices of the play. But each sentence went out
of my head before I had begun the next. I knew in the end only
that, according to all the critics, Maxine de Renzie had "surpassed
herself," had been "astonishingly great," had done "what no woman
could do unless she threw her whole soul into her part." How little
they knew where Maxine de Renzie's soul had been last night!
And&mdash;only God knew where it might be this night. Out of her
body, perhaps&mdash;the one way of escape from Raoul's hatred, if
he had come to know the truth.</p>
<p>Of course the enquiry at the hotel was not for Ivor Dundas, but
for the name he had adopted there; yet when my servant came back to
me he had nothing to tell which was consoling&mdash;rather the
other way. The gentleman had gone out about midnight (I knew that
already), and hadn't returned since. Henri had been to the Bureau
to ask, and it had struck him, he admitted to me on being
catechised, that his questions had been answered with a certain
reserve, as if more were known of the absent gentleman's movements
than it was considered wise to tell.</p>
<p>My servant had not been long away, though it seemed long to me,
and he had delayed only to buy all the evening papers, which he
"thought that Mademoiselle would like to see, as they were sure to
be filled with praise of her great acting." It was on my tongue to
scold him for stopping even one moment, when he had been told to
hurry, but he looked so pleased at his own cleverness that I hadn't
the heart to dash his happiness. I would, however, have pushed the
papers aside without so much as glancing at them, if it hadn't
suddenly occurred to me that, if any accident had befallen Ivor,
news of it might possibly have got into print by this time.</p>
<p>When I read what had happened&mdash;how he was accused of
murder, and while declaring his innocence had been silent as to all
those events which might have proved it, my heart went out to him
in a wave of gratitude. Here was a man! A man loyal and brave and
chivalrous as all men ought to be, but few are! He had sacrificed
himself to the death, no doubt, to keep my name out of the mud into
which my business had thrown him, and to save me from appearing in
Raoul's eyes the liar that I was. Had Ivor told that he was with
me, after I had prevaricated (if I had not actually lied) to Raoul
about the midnight visitor to my house, what would Raoul think of
me?</p>
<p>Ivor was trying to save me, if he could; and he had been trying
to save me when he went to the room of that dead man, though how
and when he had decided to go I knew not. If it were not for me, he
would be free and happy to-day.</p>
<p>My conscience cried out that the one thing to do was to go at
once to the Chief of Police and say: "Monsieur, this English
gentleman they have arrested cannot have committed a murder in the
Rue de la Fille Sauvage, between twelve and one last night, for he
came to my house, far away in the Rue d'Hollande, at a quarter past
twelve, and didn't leave it till after one o'clock."</p>
<p>I even sprang up from my chair in the very room where I had
hidden Ivor, to ring for Marianne and tell her to bring me a hat
and coat, to bid her order my electric brougham immediately.
But&mdash;I sat down again, sick and despairing, deliberately
crushing the generous impulse. I couldn't obey it. I dared not. By
and by, perhaps. If Ivor should be in real pressing danger, then
certainly. But not now.</p>
<p>At four o'clock Raoul came, and was with me for an hour. Each of
us tried to cheer the other. I did all I could to make him hope
that even yet he would have news of the brocade bag and its
contents. He, thinking me ill and tired out, did all he could to
persuade me that he was not miserable with anxiety. At least, he
was no longer jealous of Godensky or of any man, and was humbly
repentant for his suspicions of me the night before. When Raoul is
repentant, and wishes to atone for something that he has done, he
is enchanting. There was never a man like him.</p>
<p>At five I sent him away, with the excuse that I must rest, as I
hadn't slept much the night before; but really it was because I
feared lest I should disgrace myself before him by breaking down,
and giving him a fright&mdash;or perhaps even by being mad enough
to confess the thing I had done. I felt that I was no longer
mistress of myself&mdash;that I might be capable of any folly.</p>
<p>I could not eat, but I drank a little beef-tea before starting
for the theatre, where I went earlier than usual. It would be
something to be busy; and in my part I might even forget for a
moment, now and then.</p>
<p>Marianne and I were in my dressing-room before seven. I insisted
on dressing at once, and took as long as I could in the process of
making up; still, when I was ready there was more than half an hour
to spare before the first act. There were letters for me&mdash;the
kind that always come to the theatre&mdash;but I couldn't read
them, after I had occupied myself with tearing open the envelopes.
I knew what they would be: vows of adoration from strangers; poems
by budding poets; petitions for advice from girls and young men who
wanted to go on the stage; requests from artists who wanted to
paint my picture. There were always such things every night,
especially after the opening of a new play.</p>
<p>I was still aimlessly breaking fantastic seals, and staring
unseeingly at crests and coronets, when there came a knock at the
door. Marianne opened it, to speak for a moment with the stage door
keeper.</p>
<p>"Mademoiselle," she whispered, coming to me, "Monsieur le Comte
Godensky wishes to see you. Shall I say you are not receiving?"</p>
<p>I thought for a moment. Better see him, perhaps. I might learn
something. If not&mdash;if he had only come to torture me uselessly
to please himself, I would soon find out, and could send him
away.</p>
<p>I went into my little reception-room adjoining, and received him
there. He advanced, smiling, as one advances to a friend of whose
welcome one is sure.</p>
<p>"Well?" I asked, abruptly, when the door was shut and we were
alone. He held out his hand, but I put mine behind me, and drew
back a step when he had come too close.</p>
<p>"Well&mdash;I have news for you, that no one else could bring,
so I thought you would be glad to see&mdash;even me," he answered,
smiling still.</p>
<p>"What news? But bad, of course&mdash;or you wouldn't bring
it."</p>
<p>"You are very cruel. Of course, you've seen the evening papers?
You know that your English friend is in prison?"</p>
<p>"The same English friend whom <i>you</i> would have liked to see
arrested early last evening on a ridiculous, baseless charge," I
flung at him. "You look surprised. But you are <i>not</i>
surprised, Count Godensky&mdash;except, perhaps, that I should
guess who had me spied upon at the &Eacute;lys&eacute;e Palace
Hotel. A disappointment, that affair, wasn't it? But you haven't
told me your news."</p>
<p>"It is this: That Mr. Ivor Dundas, of England, has been on the
rack to-day."</p>
<p>"What do you mean?"</p>
<p>"He has been in the hands of the Juge d'Instruction. It is much
the same, isn't it, if one has secrets to keep? Would you like to
know, if some magical bird could tell you, what questions were put
to Mr. Dundas, and what answers he made?"</p>
<p>Strange, that this very thought had been torturing me before
Godensky came! I had been thinking of the Juge d'Instruction, and
his terrible cross-examination which only a man of steel or iron
can answer without trembling. I had thought that questions had been
asked and answers given which might mean everything to me, if I
could only have heard them. Could it be that I was to hear, now?
But I reminded myself that this was impossible. No one could know
except the Juge d'Instruction and Ivor Dundas himself. "Only two
men were present at that scene, and they will never tell what went
on," I said aloud.</p>
<p>"Three men were present," Godensky answered. "Besides the two of
whom you think, there was another: a lawyer who speaks English. It
is permitted nowadays that a foreigner, if he demands it, can be
accompanied by his legal adviser when he goes before the Juge
d'Instruction. Otherwise, his lack of knowledge of the language
might handicap him, and cause misunderstandings which would
prejudice his case."</p>
<p>He paused a moment, but I did not reply. I knew that Ivor Dundas
spoke French as well as I; but I was not going to tell this Russian
that fact.</p>
<p>"The adviser your friend has chosen," Godensky went on, "happens
to be a prot&eacute;g&eacute; of mine. I made him&mdash;gave him
his first case, his first success; and have employed him more than
once since. Odd, what a penchant Mr. Dundas seems to have for men
in whom I, too, have confidence! Last night, it was Girard. To-day,
it is Lenormand."</p>
<p>This was a blow, and a heavy one; but I wouldn't let Godensky
see that I winced under it.</p>
<p>"You keep yourself singularly well-informed of the movements of
your various prot&eacute;g&eacute;s," I said&mdash;"as well as
those of your enemies. But if the information in the one case is no
more trustworthy than in the other&mdash;why, you're not faithfully
served. I've good reason to know that you've made several mistakes
lately, and you're likely to make more."</p>
<p>"Thanks for the warning. But I hope you don't call yourself my
'enemy'?"</p>
<p>"I don't know of a more appropriate name&mdash;after the
baseness that you haven't even tried to hide, in your dealings with
me."</p>
<p>"I thought all was fair in love and war."</p>
<p>"Do you make war on women?"</p>
<p>"No&mdash;I make love to them."</p>
<p>"To many, I dare say. But here is one who won't listen."</p>
<p>"At least you will listen while I go on with the news I came to
tell?"</p>
<p>"Oh, yes, I confess to being curious. No doubt what you say will
be interesting&mdash;even if not accurate."</p>
<p>"I can promise that it shall be both. I called on Lenormand as
soon as I learned what had happened&mdash;that he'd been mixed up
in this case&mdash;and expressed myself as extremely concerned for
the fate of his client, friends of whom were intimate friends of
mine. So you see, there was no question of treachery on Lenormand's
part. He trusts me&mdash;as you do not. Indeed, I even offered my
help for Dundas, if I could give it consistently with my position.
Naturally, he told me nothing which could be used against Dundas,
so far as he knew, even if I wished to go against him&mdash;which
my coming here ought to prove to you that I do not."</p>
<p>"I read the proof rather differently," I said. "But go on. I'm
sure you are anxious to tell me certain things. Please come to the
point."</p>
<p>"In a few words, then, the point is this: One of the most
important questions put by the Juge d'Instruction, after hearing
from Mr. Dundas the explanation of a document found on him by the
police&mdash;ah, that wakes you up, Mademoiselle! You are surprised
that a document was found on the prisoner?"</p>
<p>I was half fainting with fear lest Ivor had regained the treaty,
only to lose it again in this dreadful way; but I controlled
myself.</p>
<p>"I rather hope it was not a letter from me," I said. "You know
so much, that you probably know I admitted to the police at the
&Eacute;lys&eacute;e Palace a strong friendship for Mr. Dundas. We
knew each other well in London. But London ways are different from
the ways of Paris. It isn't agreeable to be gossipped about,
however unjustly, even if one is&mdash;only an actress."</p>
<p>"You turn things cleverly, as always. Yes, you are afraid there
might have been&mdash;a letter. Yet the public adores you. It would
pardon you any indiscretion, especially a romantic one&mdash;any
indiscretion <i>except treachery</i>. There might, however, be a
few persons less indulgent. Du Laurier, for instance."</p>
<p>I shivered. "We were speaking of the scene with the Juge
d'Instruction," I reminded him. "You have wandered from the point
again."</p>
<p>"There are so many points&mdash;all sharp as swords for those
they may pierce. Well, the important question was in relation to a
letter&mdash;yes. But the letter was not from you, Mademoiselle. It
was written in English, and it made an appointment at the very
address where the crime was committed. It was, as nearly as I could
make out, a request from a person calling himself a jeweller's
assistant, for the receiver of the letter to call and return a case
containing jewels. This case had been committed to Mr. Dundas'
care, it appeared, while travelling from London to Paris, and
without his knowledge, another packet being taken away to make room
for this. Mr. Dundas replied to the Juge d'Instruction that his own
packet, stolen from him on the journey, contained nothing but
papers <i>entirely personal,</i> concerning himself alone.</p>
<p>"'What was in the case which the man afterwards murdered slipped
into your pocket?' asked the Juge d'Instruction&mdash;Lenormand
tells me.</p>
<p>"'A necklace,' answered Mr. Dundas.</p>
<p>"'A necklace of diamonds?'</p>
<p>"'Possibly diamonds, possibly paste, I wasn't much interested in
it.'</p>
<p>"'Ah, was this not the necklace which you&mdash;staying at the
&Eacute;lys&eacute;e Palace under another name&mdash;gave to
Mademoiselle Maxine de Renzie last evening?' was the next question
thrown suddenly at Mr. Dundas' head. Now, you see, Mademoiselle,
that my story is not dull."</p>
<p>"Am I to hear the rest&mdash;according to your
prot&eacute;g&eacute;?" I asked, twisting my handkerchief, as I
should have liked to twist Godensky's neck, till he had no more
breath or wickedness left in him.</p>
<p>"Mr. Dundas tried his best to convince the Juge d'Instruction, a
most clever and experienced man, that if he had, as an old friend,
brought you a present of diamonds, it was something entirely
different, and therefore far removed from this case.</p>
<p>"'Are you not Mademoiselle de Renzie's lover?' was the next
enquiry. 'I admire her, as do thousands of others, who also respect
her as I do,' your friend returned very prettily. At last, dearest
lady, you begin to see what there is in this string of questions
and answers to bring me straight to you?"</p>
<p>"No, Count Godensky, I do not," I answered steadily. But a
sudden illuminating ray did show me, even as I spoke, what
<i>might</i> be in his scheming mind.</p>
<p>"Then I must be clear, and, above all, frank. Du Laurier loves
you. You love him. You mean, I think, to marry him. But deeply in
love as he is, he is a very proud fellow. He will have all or
nothing, if I judge him well; and he would not take for his wife a
woman who accepts diamonds from another man, saying as she takes
them that he is her lover."</p>
<p>"He wouldn't believe it of me!" I cried.</p>
<p>"There is a way of convincing him. Oh, <i>I</i> shall not tell
him! But he shall see in writing all that passed between the Juge
d'Instruction and Mr. Dundas, unless&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Unless?&mdash;but I know what you mean to threaten. You repeat
yourself."</p>
<p>"Not quite, for I have new arguments, and stronger ones. I want
you, Maxine. I mean to have you&mdash;or I will crush you, and now
you know I can. Choose."</p>
<p>I sprang up, and looked at him. Perhaps there was murder in my
eyes, as for a moment there was in my heart, for he exclaimed:</p>
<p>"Tigeress! You would kill me if you could. But that doesn't make
me love you less. Would du Laurier have you if he knew what you
are&mdash;as he will know soon unless you let me save you? Yet
I&mdash;I would love you if you were a murderess as well as
a&mdash;spy."</p>
<p>"It is you who are a spy!" I faltered, now all but broken.</p>
<p>"If I am, I haven't spied in vain. Not only can I ruin you with
du Laurier, and before the world, but I can ruin him utterly and in
all ways."</p>
<p>"No&mdash;no," I gasped. "You cannot. You're boasting. You can
do nothing."</p>
<p>"Nothing to-night, perhaps. I'm not speaking of to-night. I am
giving you time. But to-morrow&mdash;or the day after. It's much
the same to me. At first, when I began to suspect that something
had been taken from its place, I had no proof. I had to get that,
and I did get it&mdash;nearly all I wanted. This affair of Dundas
might have been planned for my advantage. It is perfect. All its
complications are just so many links in a chain for me.
Girard&mdash;the man Dundas chose to employ&mdash;was the very man
I'd sent to England; on what errand, do you think? To watch your
friend the British Foreign Secretary. He followed Dundas to Paris
on the bare suspicion that there'd been, communication between the
two, and he was preparing a report for me when&mdash;Dundas called
on him."</p>
<p>"What connection can Ivor Dundas' coming to Paris have with
Raoul du Laurier?" I dared to ask.</p>
<p>"You know best as to that."</p>
<p>"They have never met. Both are men of honour, and&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Men of honour are tricked by women sometimes, and then they
have to suffer for being fools, as if they had been villains. Think
what such a man&mdash;a man of honour, as you say&mdash;would feel
when he found out the woman!"</p>
<p>"A woman can be calumniated as well as a man," I said. "You are
so unscrupulous you would stoop to anything, I know that. Raoul du
Laurier has done nothing; I&mdash;I have done nothing of which to
be ashamed. Yet you can lie about us, ruin him perhaps by a plot,
as if he were guilty, and&mdash;and do terrible harm to me."</p>
<p>"I can&mdash;without the trouble of lying. And I will, unless
you'll give up du Laurier and make up your mind to marry me. I
always meant to have you. You are the one woman worthy of me."</p>
<p>"You are the man most unworthy of any woman. But, give me till
to-morrow evening&mdash;at this time&mdash;to decide. Will you
promise me that?"</p>
<p>"No, I know what you would do. You would kill yourself. It is
what is in your mind now. I won't risk losing you. I have waited
long enough already. Give me a ring of yours, and a written word
from you to du Laurier, saying that you find you have made a
mistake; and not only will I do nothing to injure him, but will
guard against the discovery of&mdash;you know what. Besides, as a
matter of course, I'll bring all my influence to bear in keeping
your name out of this or any other scandal. I can do much,
everything indeed, for I admit that it was through me the
Commissary of Police trapped you with Dundas. I will say that I
blundered. I know what to do to save you, and I will do
it&mdash;for my future wife."</p>
<p>"No power on earth could induce me to break with Raoul du
Laurier in the way you wish," I said. "If&mdash;if I am to give him
up, I must tell him with my own lips, and bid him good-bye. I will
do this to-morrow, if you will hold your hand until then."</p>
<p>We looked at each other for a long moment in silence. Godensky
was trying to read my mind, and to make up his accordingly.</p>
<p>"You swear by everything you hold sacred to break with him
to-morrow?"</p>
<p>"By the memory of my father and mother, martyred by bureaucrats
like you, I pledge my word that&mdash;that&mdash;if I can't break
with Raoul, to let you know the first thing in the morning, and
dare you to do&mdash;what you will."</p>
<p>"You will not 'dare' me, I think. And because I think so, I will
wait&mdash;a little longer."</p>
<p>"Until this time to-morrow?"</p>
<p>"No. For if you cheated me, it would be too late to act for
another twelve hours. But I will give you till to-morrow noon. You
agree to that?"</p>
<p>"I agree." My lips formed the words. I hardly spoke them; but he
understood, and with a flash in his eyes took a step towards me as
if to snatch my hand. I drew away. He followed, but at this instant
Marianne appeared at the door.</p>
<p>"There is a young lady to see Mademoiselle," she announced, her
good-natured, open face showing all her dislike of Count Godensky.
"A young lady who sends this note, begging that Mademoiselle will
read it at once, and consent to see her."</p>
<p>Thankful that the t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te had been
interrupted, I held out my hand for the letter. Marianne gave it to
me. I glanced at the name written below the lines which only half
filled the first page of theatre paper, and found it strange to me.
But, even if I had not been ready to snatch at the chance of
ridding myself immediately of Godensky, the few words above the
unfamiliar name would have made me say as I did say, "Bring the
young lady in at once."</p>
<DIV class="poem">
 <p>"I come to you from Mr. Dundas, on business which he told me was
    of the greatest and most pressing importance.<br><br>
    "DIANA FORREST."</p>
</DIV>
<p>That was the whole contents of the note; but a dozen sheets
closely filled with arguments could not have moved me more.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>MAXINE MEETS DIANA</h3>
<p>Godensky was obliged to take his leave, which he did abruptly,
but to all appearance with a good grace; and when he was gone
Marianne ushered in a girl&mdash;a tall, beautiful girl in a grey
tailor dress built by an artist.</p>
<p>For such time as it might have taken us to count twelve, we
looked at each other; and as we looked, a little clock on the
mantel softly chimed the quarter hour. In fifteen minutes I should
be due upon the stage.</p>
<p>The girl was very lovely. Yes, lovely was the right word for
her&mdash;lovely and lovable. She was like a fresh rose, with the
morning dew of youth on its petals&mdash;a rose that had budded and
was beginning to bloom in a fair garden, far out of reach of ugly
weeds. I envied her, for I felt how different her sweet, girl's
life had been from my stormy if sometimes brilliant career.</p>
<p>"Mr. Dundas sent you to me?" I asked. "When did you see him?
Surely not&mdash;since&mdash;"</p>
<p>"This afternoon," she answered quietly, in a pretty, un-English
sounding voice, with a soft little drawl of the South in it. "I
went to see him. They gave us five minutes. A warder was there; but
speaking quickly in Spanish, just a few words, he&mdash;Mr.
Dundas&mdash;managed to tell me a thing he wished me to do. He said
it meant more than his life, so I did it; for we have been friends,
and just now he's helpless. The warder was angry, and stopped our
conversation at once, though the five minutes weren't ended. But I
understood. Mr. Dundas said there wasn't a moment to lose."</p>
<p>"Yet that was in the afternoon, and you only come to me at this
hour!" I exclaimed.</p>
<p>"I had something else to do first," she said, in the same quiet
voice. She was looking down now, not at me, and her eyelashes were
so long that they made a shadow on her cheeks. But the blood
streamed over her face.</p>
<p>"Even before I saw&mdash;Mr. Dundas," she went on, "I had the
idea of calling on you&mdash;about a different matter. I think it
would be more honest of me, if before I go on I tell you
that&mdash;quite by accident, so far as I was concerned&mdash;I was
with someone who saw Mr. Dundas go to your house last night, a
little after twelve. I didn't dream of spying on&mdash;either of
you. It just happened, it wouldn't interest you to know how.
Yet&mdash;I beg of you to tell me one thing. Was he with you for
long&mdash;so long that he couldn't have got to the other place in
time to commit the murder?"</p>
<p>"He was in my house until after one," I said boldly. "But you,
if you are his friend, ought to know him well enough to be certain
without such an assurance from me, that he is no murderer."</p>
<p>"Oh, I am certain," she protested. "I asked the question, not
for that reason, but to know if you could really prove his
innocence, if you choose. Now, I find you can. When I read the
papers this afternoon, at first I wanted to rush off to the police
and tell them where he had been while the murder was being
committed. But I didn't know how long he had stopped in your house,
and, besides&mdash;"</p>
<p>"You would have dared to do that!" I broke in, the blood, angry
blood, stinging my cheeks more hotly than it stung hers.</p>
<p>"It wasn't a question of daring," she answered. "I thought of
him more than of you; but I thought of you, too. I knew that if I
were in your place, no matter how much harm I might do to myself, I
would confess that he had been in my house."</p>
<p>"There are reasons why I can't tell that he was there," I said,
trying to awe her by speaking coldly and proudly. "His visit was
entirely on business. But Mr. Dundas understands why I must keep
silence, and he approves. You know he has remained silent
himself."</p>
<p>"For your sake, because he is a gentleman&mdash;brave and
chivalrous. Would you take advantage of that?"</p>
<p>"You take advantage of me," I flung back at the girl, looking
her up and down. "You pretend that you came from Mr. Dundas with a
pressing message for me. Do you want me to believe <i>this</i> his
message? I think too well of him."</p>
<p>"I don't want you to believe that," she answered. "I haven't
come to the message yet. I have earned a right to speak to you
first, on my own account."</p>
<p>"In twelve minutes I must be on the stage," I said.</p>
<p>"The stage!" she echoed. "You can go on acting just the same,
though he is in prison&mdash;for you!"</p>
<p>"I must go on acting. If I didn't, I should do him more harm
than good."</p>
<p>"I won't keep you beyond your time. But I beg that you
<i>will</i> do him good. If you care for him at all, you must want
to save him."</p>
<p>"If I care for him?" I repeated, in surprise. "You
think&mdash;oh, but I understand now. You are the girl he spoke
of."</p>
<p>She blushed deeply, and then grew pale.</p>
<p>"I did not think he would speak of me," she said. "I wish he
hadn't. But, if you know everything, the little there is to know,
you must see that you have nothing to fear from any rivalry of
mine, Mademoiselle de Renzie."</p>
<p>"Why," I exclaimed, "you speak as if you thought Ivor Dundas my
lover."</p>
<p>"I don't know what you are to each other," she faltered, all her
coolness deserting her. "That isn't my affair&mdash;"</p>
<p>"But I say it is. You shall not make such a mistake. Mr. Dundas
cares nothing for me, except as a friend. He never did, though we
flirted a little a year ago, to amuse ourselves. Now, I am engaged
to marry a man whom I worship. I would gladly die for him. Ivor
Dundas knows that, and is glad. But the other man is jealous. He
wouldn't understand&mdash;he would want to kill me and himself and
Ivor Dundas, if he knew that Ivor was in my house last night. He
was there too, and I lied to him about Ivor. How could I expect him
to believe the real truth now? He is a man. But <i>you</i> will
believe, because you are a woman, like myself, and I think the
woman Ivor Dundas loves."</p>
<p>Her beautiful eyes brightened. "He told you&mdash;that?"</p>
<p>"He told me he loved a girl, and was afraid that he would lose
her because of the business which brought him to me. You seem to
have been as unreasonable with him, as Ra&mdash;as the man I love
could be with me. Poor Ivor! Last night was not the first time that
he sacrificed himself for chivalry and honour. Yet you blame me!
Look to yourself, Miss Forrest."</p>
<p>"I&mdash;I don't blame you," she stammered, a sob in her voice.
"Only I beg you to save him, from gratitude, if not from love."</p>
<p>"It's true I owe him a debt of gratitude, deeper than you know,"
I answered. "He is worth trusting&mdash;worth saving, at the
expense of almost any sacrifice. But I can't sacrifice the man I
love for him."</p>
<p>She looked thoughtful. "You say the man you were engaged to was
at your house while Ivor was there?"</p>
<p>"Yes. He came then. I hid Ivor, and I lied."</p>
<p>"He suspected that someone was with you? He stood watching,
outside your gate?"</p>
<p>"He confessed that, when I'd made him repent his jealousy. Why
do you ask? You saw him?"</p>
<p>"I think so. Tell me, Mademoiselle de Renzie, did he lose
anything of value near your house?"</p>
<p>"Great heavens, yes!" I cried. "What do you know of that?"</p>
<p>"I know&mdash;something. Enough, maybe, to help you to find the
thing for him&mdash;if you will promise to help Ivor."</p>
<p>"Oh, shame," I cried violently, sick of bargains and promises.
"You are trying to bribe me!"</p>
<p>"Yes, but I am not ashamed," the girl answered, holding her head
high. "I have not the thing which was lost; but I can get it for
you&mdash;this very night or to-morrow morning, if you will do what
I ask."</p>
<p>"I tell you I cannot," I said. "Not even to get back that thing
whose loss was the beginning of all my misery. Ivor would not wish
me to ruin myself and&mdash;another. Mr. Dundas must be saved
without me. Please go. If we talked of this together all night, it
could make no difference. And I'm in great trouble, great trouble
of my own."</p>
<p>"Has your trouble anything to do with a document?" Miss Forrest
slowly asked.</p>
<p>I started, and stared at her, breathless.</p>
<p>"It has!" she answered for me. "Your face tells me so."</p>
<p>"Has Ivor's message&mdash;to do with that?" I almost gasped.</p>
<p>"Perhaps. But he had no good news of it to give you. If you want
news&mdash;if you want the document, it must be through me."</p>
<p>"Anything, anything on earth you like to ask for the document,
if you can get it for me, I will do," I pleaded, all my pride and
anger gone.</p>
<p>"I ask you to tell the police that Ivor Dundas was in your house
from a little after midnight until after one. Will you do
that?"</p>
<p>"I must," I said, "if you have the document to sell, and are
determined to sell it at no other price. But if I do what you ask,
it will spoil my life, for it will kill my lover's love, when he
knows I have lied to him. Still, it will save him from&mdash;" I
stopped, and bit my lip. "Will you give me the diamonds, too?" I
asked, humbly enough now.</p>
<p>"The diamonds?" She looked bewildered.</p>
<p>"The diamonds in the brocade bag. Oh, surely they <i>are</i>
still in the bag?"</p>
<p>"Yes, they are&mdash;they will be in the bag," the girl
answered, her charming mouth suddenly resolute, though her eyes
were troubled. "You shall have the diamonds, and the document, too,
for that one promise."</p>
<p>"How is it possible that you can give me the document?" I asked,
half suspicious, for that it should come to me after all I had
endured because of it seemed too good to be true; that it should
come through this girl seemed incredible.</p>
<p>"Ivor sent me to find it, and I found it," she said simply.
"That was why I couldn't come to you before. I had to get the
document. I didn't quite know how I was to do it at first, because
I had no one to help or advise me; and Ivor said it was under some
flower-pots in a box on the balcony of the room where the man was
murdered. I was sure I wouldn't be allowed to get into the room
itself, so it seemed difficult. But I thought it all out, and hired
a room for the evening in a house next door, pretending I was a New
York journalist. I had to wait until after dark, and then I climbed
across from one balcony to the other. It wasn't as easy to do as it
looked from the photograph I saw, because it was so high up, and
the balconies were quite far apart, after all. But I couldn't fail
Ivor; and I got across. The rest was nothing&mdash;except the
climbing back. I don't know how the document came in the box,
though I suppose Ivor put it there to hide it from the police. It
was wrapped up in a towel; and it's quite clean."</p>
<p>"I think," I said slowly, when she had finished her story, "that
you have a right to set a high price on that document. You are a
brave girl."</p>
<p>"It's not much to be brave for a man you love, is it? And now
I'm going to give the thing to you, because I trust you,
Mademoiselle de Renzie. I know you'll pay. And I hope, oh, I
<i>feel</i>, it won't hurt you as you think it will."</p>
<p>Then, as if it had been some ordinary paper, she whipped from a
long pocket of a coat she wore, the treaty. She put it into my
hand. I felt it, I clasped it. I could have kissed it. The very
touch of it made me tremble.</p>
<p>"Do you know what this is, Miss Forrest?" I asked.</p>
<p>"No," she said. "It was yours, or Ivor's. Of course I didn't
look."</p>
<p>And then there came the rap, rap, of the call-boy at the door.
The fifteen minutes were over. But I had the treaty. And I had to
pay its price.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>MAXINE PLAYS THE LAST HAND OF THE GAME</h3>
<p>When the play was over, I let Raoul drive home with me to
supper. If Godensky knew, as he may have known&mdash;since he
seemed to know all my movements&mdash;perhaps he thought that I was
seeing Raoul for the last time, and sending him away from me for
ever. But, though the game was not in my hands yet, the treaty was;
and I had made up my mind to defy Godensky.</p>
<p>I had almost promised that, if he held his hand, I would give
Raoul up; and never have I broken my word. But if I wrote a letter
to Godensky in the morning, saying I had changed my mind, that he
could do his worst against Raoul du Laurier and against me, for
nothing should part us two except death? Then he would have fair
warning that I did not intend to do the thing to which he had
nearly forced me; and I would fight him, when he tried to take
revenge. But meanwhile, before he got that letter, I would&mdash;I
must&mdash;find some way of putting the treaty back in its place at
the Foreign Office.</p>
<p>It was too soon to dare to be happy, yet; for it was on the
cards that, even when I had saved Raoul from the consequences of my
political treachery, Godensky might still be able to ruin me with
him. Yet, the relief I felt after the all but hopeless anguish in
which I had been drowning for the last few days gave to my spirit a
wild exhilaration that night. I encouraged Raoul with hints that I
had news of the necklace, and said that, if he would let me come to
him in his office as soon as it was open in the morning, I might be
able to surprise him pleasantly. Of course, he answered that it
would give him the greatest joy to see me there, or anywhere; and
we parted with an appointment for nine o'clock next day.</p>
<p>When he had gone, I wrote a note&mdash;a very short
note&mdash;to Count Godensky. I wanted to have it ready; but I did
not mean to send it till the treaty was in the safe whence I had
taken it. Then, the letter should go at once, by messenger; and it
would still be very early in the day, I hoped.</p>
<p>Usually, I have my cup of chocolate in bed at nine; but on the
morning which followed I was dressed and ready to go out at half
past eight. I think that I had not slept at all, but that didn't
matter. I felt strong and fresh, and my heart was full of courage.
I was leaving nothing to chance. I had a plan, and knew how I meant
to play the last hand in the game. It might go against me. But I
held a high trump. Again, as before, Raoul received me alone.</p>
<p>"Dearest," he exclaimed, "I know your news must be good, for you
look so bright and beautiful. Tell me&mdash;tell me!"</p>
<p>I laughed, teasingly, though Heaven knew I was in no mood for
teasing.</p>
<p>"You're too impatient," I said. "To punish you for asking about
the wretched diamonds before you enquired how I slept, and whether
I dreamed of you, I shall make you pay a penalty."</p>
<p>"Any penalty you will," he answered, laughing too, and entering
into the joke&mdash;for he was happy and hopeful now, seeing that I
could joke.</p>
<p>"Let me sit down and write at your desk, on a bit of your
paper," I said.</p>
<p>He gave me pen and ink. I scribbled off a few words, and folded
the note into an envelope.</p>
<p>"Now, this is very precious," I went on. "It tells you all you
want to know. But&mdash;I'm going to post it."</p>
<p>"No, no!" he protested. "I can't wait for the post."</p>
<p>"Oh, I wouldn't trust my treasure to the post office, not even
if it were insured. Open that wonderful safe you gave me a peep
into the other day, and I'll put this valuable document in among
the others, not more valuable to the country than this ought to be
to you. I'll hide it there, and you must shut up the safe without
looking for it, till I've gone. Then, you must count ten, and after
that&mdash;you may search. Remember, you said you'd submit to any
penalty, so no excuses, no complaints."</p>
<p>Raoul laughed. "You shall have your way, fantastic though it be,
for you are a sorceress, and have bewitched me."</p>
<p>He unlocked the door of the safe and stood waiting for me to
gratify my whim. But I gaily motioned him behind me. "If you stand
there you can see where I put it, and that won't! be fair play.
Turn your back."</p>
<p>He obeyed. "You see how I trust you!" he said. "There lie my
country's secrets."</p>
<p>"They're safe from me," I said pertly. (And so indeed they
were&mdash;now.) "They're too uninteresting to amuse me in the
least."</p>
<p>As I spoke I found and abstracted the dummy treaty and slipped
the real one into its place. Then I laid the envelope with the note
I had written where he could not help finding it at first or second
glance.</p>
<p>"Now you can close the safe," I said.</p>
<p>He shut the door, and I almost breathed aloud the words that
burst from my heart, "Thank Heaven!"</p>
<p>"I must leave you," I told him. And I was kind for a moment,
capricious no longer, because, though the treaty had been restored,
I was going to open the cage of Godensky's vengeance, and&mdash;I
was afraid of him.</p>
<p>"I may come to you as soon as I'm free?" Raoul asked.</p>
<p>"Yes. Come and tell me what you think of the news,
and&mdash;what you think of me," I said. And while I spoke,
smiling, I prayed within that he might continue to think of me all
things good&mdash;far better than I deserved, yet not better than I
would try to deserve in the future, if I were permitted to spend
that future with him.</p>
<p>The next thing I did was to send my letter to Count Godensky.
This was a flinging down of the glove, and I knew it well. But I
was ready to fight now.</p>
<p>Then, I had to keep my promise to Miss Forrest. But I had
thought of a way in which, I hoped, that promise&mdash;fulfilled as
I meant to fulfil it&mdash;might help rather than injure me. I had
not lain awake all night for nothing.</p>
<p>I went to the office of the Chief of Police, who is a gentleman
and a patron of the theatre&mdash;when he can spare time from his
work. I had met him, and had reason to know that he admired my
acting.</p>
<p>His first words were of congratulation upon my success in the
new play; and he was as cordial, as complimentary, as if he had
never heard of that scene at the &Eacute;lys&eacute;e Palace Hotel,
about which of course he knew everything&mdash;so far as his
subordinate could report.</p>
<p>"Are you surprised to see me, Monsieur?" I asked.</p>
<p>"A great delight is always more or less of a surprise in this
work-a-day world," he gallantly replied.</p>
<p>"But you can guess what has brought me?"</p>
<p>"Would that I could think it was only to give me a box at the
theatre this evening."</p>
<p>"It is partly that," I laughed. "Partly for the pleasure of
seeing you, of course. And partly&mdash;you know already, since you
know everything, that I am a friend of Mr. Dundas, the young
Englishman accused of a murder which he could not possibly have
committed."</p>
<p>"Could not possibly have committed? Is that merely your opinion
as a loyal friend, or have you come to make a communication to
me?"</p>
<p>"For that&mdash;and to offer you the stage-box for
to-night."</p>
<p>"A thousand thanks for the box. As for the
communication&mdash;"</p>
<p>"It's this. Mr. Dundas was in my house at the time when,
according to the doctors' statements, the murder must have been
committed. Oh, it's a hard thing for me to come and tell you this!"
I went on hastily. "Not that I'm ashamed to have received a call
from him at that hour, as it was necessary to see him then, or not
at all. He meant to leave Paris early in the morning.
But&mdash;because I'm engaged to be married to&mdash;perhaps you
know that, though, among other things?"</p>
<p>"I've heard&mdash;a rumour. I didn't know that it amounted to an
engagement. Monsieur du Laurier is to be a thousand times
congratulated."</p>
<p>"I love him dearly," I said simply. And, not because I am an
actress, but because I am a a woman and had suffered all that I
could bear, tears rose to my eyes. "I am true to him, and always
have been. But&mdash;he is horribly jealous. I can't explain Mr.
Dundas' night visit in a way to satisfy him. If Raoul finds out
that an Englishman&mdash;well-known, but of whom I never
spoke&mdash;was at my house after midnight, he will believe I have
deceived him. Oh, Monsieur, if you would help me to keep this
secret I am telling you so frankly!"</p>
<p>"Keep the secret, yet use it to free the Englishman?" asked the
Chief of Police gravely.</p>
<p>"Yes, I ask no less of you; I beg, I implore you. It would kill
me to break with Raoul du Laurier."</p>
<p>"Dear Mademoiselle," said the good and gallant man, "trust me to
do the best I can for you." (I could see that my tears had moved
him.) "A grief to you would be a blow to Paris. Yet&mdash;well, as
you have been frank, I owe it to you to be equally so on my side. I
should before this have sent&mdash;quite privately and in a
friendly way, to question you about this Mr. Dundas, who passed
under another name at the hotel where you called upon him; but I
received a request from a very high quarter to wait before
communicating with you. Now, as you have come to me, I suppose I
may speak."</p>
<p>"Ask me any questions you choose," I said, "and I'll answer
them."</p>
<p>"Then, to begin with, since you are engaged to Monsieur du
Laurier, how do you explain the statement you made at the hotel,
concerning Mr. Dundas?"</p>
<p>"That is one of the many things I have come here on purpose to
tell you," I answered him; "for I am going to give you my whole
confidence. I throw myself upon your mercy."</p>
<p>"You do me a great honour. Will you speak without my
prompting?"</p>
<p>"Yes. I would prefer it. In England, a year ago, I had a little
flirtation with Mr. Dundas&mdash;no more, though we liked and
admired each other. We exchanged a few silly letters, and I forgot
all about them until I fell in love with Raoul and promised to
marry him&mdash;only a short time ago. Then I couldn't bear to
think that I had written these foolish letters, and that, perhaps,
Mr. Dundas might have kept them. I wrote and asked if he had. He
answered that he had every one, and valued them immensely, but if I
wished, he would either burn all, or bring them to me, whichever I
chose. I chose to have him bring them, and I told him that I'd meet
him at the &Eacute;lys&eacute;e Palace Hotel on a certain evening,
to receive the letters from him."</p>
<p>"He came, as I said, under another name. Why was that,
Mademoiselle, since there was nothing for him to be ashamed
of?"</p>
<p>"He also is in love, and just engaged to be married to an
American girl who lives with relations in London, in a very high
position. He didn't want the girl to know he was coming to Paris,
because, it seems, there had been a little talk about him and me,
which she had heard. And she didn't like it."</p>
<p>"I see. This gentleman started for Paris, I have learned, the
first thing in the morning, the day after a ball at a house where
he met the British Secretary for Foreign Affairs."</p>
<p>"Perhaps. For I have enquired and found out that the
girl&mdash;a Miss Forrest, is distantly connected with the British
Foreign Secretary. She lives with her aunt, Lady Mountstuart, whose
sister is married to that gentleman. And the Foreign Secretary is a
cousin of Lord Mountstuart."</p>
<p>"Ah, Miss Forrest!"</p>
<p>"You know of her already?"</p>
<p>"I have heard her name."</p>
<p>(I guessed how: for she could not have seen Ivor Dundas in
prison except through the Chief of Police; but I said nothing of
that.)</p>
<p>"You say you know how we met at the hotel, Mr. Dundas and I," I
went on. "But I'll explain to you now the inner meaning of it all,
which even you can't have found out. Mr. Dundas was to have brought
me my letters&mdash;half a dozen. He gave me a leather case, which
he took from an inner breast pocket, saying the letters were in it.
But the room was dark. Something had gone wrong with the
electricity, and I hadn't let him push back the curtains, for fear
I might be seen from outside, if the lights should suddenly come
on. He didn't see the case, as he handed it to me, nor could I.
Just at that instant there was a knock at the door; and quick as
thought I pushed the leather case down between the seat and back of
the sofa."</p>
<p>"But what reason had you to suppose that any danger of discovery
threatened you because of a knock at the door?"</p>
<p>"I'll tell you. There is a man&mdash;I won't mention his name,
but you know it very well, and maybe it is in your mind
now&mdash;who wants me to marry him. He has wanted it for some
time&mdash;I think because he admires women who are before the
public and applauded by the world; also, perhaps, because I have
refused him, and he is one who wants most what he finds hardest to
get. He is not a scrupulous person, but he has some power and a
good deal of influence, because he is very highly connected, and
when people have 'axes to grind' he helps to grind them. He has
suspected for some time that I cared for M. du Laurier, and for
that he has hated Raoul. I have fancied&mdash;that he hired
detectives to spy upon me; and my instinct as well as common sense
told me that he would let no chance slip to separate me from the
man I love. He would work mischief between us&mdash;or he would try
to ruin Raoul, or crush me&mdash;anything to keep us apart. When I
saw the Commissary of Police I was hardly surprised, and though I
didn't know what pretext had brought him, I said to myself 'That is
the work of&mdash;'"</p>
<p>"Perhaps better not mention the name, Mademoiselle."</p>
<p>"I didn't mean to. I leave that to your&mdash;imagination. 'This
is the work of the man whose love is more cruel than hate,' I
thought. While I wondered what possible use the police could make
of my letters, I was shaking with terror lest they should come upon
them and they should somehow fall into&mdash;a certain man's hands.
Then, at last, they did find the case, just as I'd begun to hope it
was safe. I begged the Commissary of Police not to open it. In
vain. When he did, what was my relief to see the diamond necklace
you must have heard of!&mdash;my relief and my surprise. And now
I'm going to confide in you the secret of another, speaking to you
as my friend, and a man of honour.</p>
<p>"Those jewels had been stolen only a few days ago from Monsieur
du Laurier, and he was in despair at their loss, for they belonged
to a dear friend of his&mdash;an inveterate gambler, but an
adorable woman. She dared not tell her husband of money that she'd
lost, but begged Raoul to sell the diamonds for her in Amsterdam
and have them replaced by paste. On his way there the necklace was
stolen by an expert thief, who must somehow have learned what was
going on through the pawnbroker with whom the jewels had been in
pledge&mdash;for a few thousand francs only. You can imagine my
astonishment at seeing the necklace returned in such a miraculous
way. I thought that Ivor Dundas must have got it back, meaning to
give it to me as a surprise&mdash;and the letters afterwards. And
it was only to keep the letters out of the affair altogether at any
price&mdash;evidences in black and white of my silly
flirtation&mdash;and also to avoid any association of Raoul's name
with the necklace, that I told the Commissary of Police the leather
case had in it a present from my lover. I spoke impulsively, in
sheer desperation; and the instant the words were out I would have
cut off my hand to take back the stupid falsehood. But what good to
deny what I had just said? The men wouldn't have believed me.</p>
<p>"When the police had gone, I asked Mr. Dundas for my letters.
But he thought he had given them to me&mdash;and he knew no more of
the diamonds in their red case than I did&mdash;far less,
indeed.</p>
<p>"I was distracted to find that my letters had disappeared,
though I was thankful for Raoul's sake, to have the necklace. Mr.
Dundas believed that his own leather case with the letters must
have been stolen from his pocket in the train, though he couldn't
imagine why the diamonds had been given to him instead. But he
suspected a travelling companion of his, who had acted queerly; and
he determined to try and find the man. He was to bring me news
after the theatre at my house, about midnight.</p>
<p>"He came fifteen minutes later, having been detained at his
hotel. Friends of his had unexpectedly arrived. He had just time to
tell me this, and that after going out on a false scent he had
employed a detective named Girard, when Monsieur du Laurier arrived
unexpectedly. It seems, he'd been made frantically jealous by some
misrepresentations of&mdash;the man whose name we haven't
mentioned. I begged Mr. Dundas to hide in my boudoir, which he
disliked doing, but finally did, to please me. I hoped that he
would escape by the window, but it stuck, and to my horror I heard
him there, in the dark, moving about. I covered the sounds as well
as I could, and pacified Raoul, who thought he had seen someone
come in. I hinted that it must have been the fianc&eacute; of a
pretty housemaid I have. It was not till after one that Ivor Dundas
finally got away; this I swear to you. What happened to him after
leaving my house you know better than I do, for I haven't seen him
since, as you are well aware."</p>
<p>"He says he found a letter from the thief in his pocket, and
went to the address named; that he couldn't get a cab and walked.
But you have read the papers,"</p>
<p>"Yes, and I know how loyal he has been to me. Why, he wouldn't
even tell about the diamonds, much less my letters!"</p>
<p>"As for these letters, you are still anxious about them,
Mademoiselle?"</p>
<p>"My hope is that Mr. Dundas found and had time to destroy them,
rather than risk further delay."</p>
<p>"You would like to know their fate?"</p>
<p>"I would indeed."</p>
<p>"Well, I applaud the Englishman's chivalry. Vive l'Entente
Cordiale!"</p>
<p>"You are a man to understand such chivalry, Monsieur. Now that
I've humbled myself, can't you give me hope that he'll soon be
released, and yet that&mdash;that I shan't be made to suffer for my
confession to you? It's clear to you, isn't it, that the murder
must have been done long before he could have reached the house in
the Rue de la Fille Sauvage from the Rue d'Hollande?"</p>
<p>"Yes, that is clear. And needless to say, I believe your
statement, Mademoiselle. You are brave and good to have come
forward as you have, without being called upon. There are still
some formalities to be gone through before Mr. Dundas can be
released; but English influence is at work in high quarters, and
after what you have told me, I think he will not much longer be
under restraint. Besides, I may as well inform you, dear lady, that
not ten minutes before you arrived this morning I received
satisfactory news of the arrest of two Englishmen at Frankfort, who
seem to have been concerned in this business in the Rue de la Fille
Sauvage. They certainly travelled with the murdered man; and a
friend of his called Gestre, just back from Marseilles, has sworn
that these persons were formerly partners of Janson, the deceased.
If Janson stole the necklace from Monsieur du Laurier, with this
pair as accomplices, and then tried to cheat them, a motive for the
crime is evident. And we are getting at Janson's record, which
seems to be a bad one&mdash;a notorious one throughout Europe, if
he proves to be the man we think. I hope, really, that in a very
few days Mr. Dundas may be able to thank you in person for what
you've done for him, and&mdash;to tell you what has become of those
letters."</p>
<p>"What good will their destruction do me, though, if you are not
merciful?"</p>
<p>"I intend to be, for I can combine mercy with justice. Dear
Mademoiselle, Monsieur du Laurier need never know the circumstances
you have told to me, or that the Englishman's alibi has been proved
by you. The arrest of these two men in Frankfort will, I feel sure,
help the police to keep your secret as you would keep it yourself.
Now, will that assurance make it easier for you to put your whole
soul into your part to-night?"</p>
<p>"If you will accept that box," I said, letting him kiss my hand,
and feeling inclined to kiss his.</p>
<p>Then I drove home, with my heart singing, for I felt almost sure
that I had trumped Godensky's last trick now.</p>
<p>When I reached home Miss Forrest was there. She had brought the
diamonds in the brocade bag. Oddly enough, the ribbons which
fastened it were torn out, as if there had been a struggle for the
possession of the bag. But Miss Forrest did not explain this, or
even allude to it at all.</p>
<p>I thanked her for coming and for bringing the jewels. "I have
kept my promise," I said. "The man you love will be free in a few
days. Will you let me say that I think you are a very noble pair,
and I hope you will be happy together."</p>
<p>"I shall try to make up to him for&mdash;my hateful suspicions
and&mdash;everything," she said, like a repentant child. "I love
him so much!"</p>
<p>"And he you. You almost broke his heart by throwing him over; I
saw that. But how gloriously you will mend it again!"</p>
<p>"Oh, I hope so!" she cried. "And you&mdash;have I really spoiled
your life by forcing you to make that promise? I pray that I
haven't."</p>
<p>"I thought you had, but I was mistaken," I answered. "The thing
you have made me do has proved a blessing. I may have&mdash;altered
some of the facts a little, but none of those that concern Mr.
Dundas. And a woman has to use such weapons as she has, against
cruel enemies."</p>
<p>"I hope you'll defeat yours," said Miss Forrest.</p>
<p>"I begin to believe I shall," said I. And we shook hands. She is
the only girl I ever saw who seemed to me worthy of Ivor
Dundas.</p>
<p>Early in the afternoon Raoul came, and the first thing I did was
to give him the diamonds.</p>
<p>"You are my good angel!" he exclaimed. "Thank Heaven, I won't
have to take your money now."</p>
<p>"All that's mine is yours," I said.</p>
<p>"It is <i>you</i> I want for mine," he answered. "When am I to
have you? Don't keep me waiting long, my darling. I'm nothing
without you."</p>
<p>"I don't want to keep you waiting," I told him. And indeed I
longed to be his wife&mdash;his, in spite of Godensky; his, till
death us should part.</p>
<p>He took me in his arms, and then, when I had promised to marry
him as soon as a marriage could be arranged, our talk drifted back
to the morning, and the note I had written, telling him that a
pretty American girl had found the diamonds.</p>
<p>"She's engaged to marry Ivor Dundas, an old friend of
mine&mdash;the poor fellow so stupidly accused of murder," I
explained. "But of course he is innocent. Of course he'll be
discharged without a blot upon his name. They're tremendously in
love with each other, almost as much as you and I!"</p>

<p>"You didn't tell me about the love affair in your note," said
Raoul. "You spoke only of the girl, and the coincidence of her
driving past your house, after I went in."</p>
<p>"There wasn't time for more in that famous communication!" I
laughed.</p>
<p>Raoul echoed me. "It came rather too near being famous, by the
way," he said. "Just after I had found it in the safe&mdash;where
you would put it, you witch!&mdash;a man came in with an order from
the President to copy a clause in a new treaty which is kept
there."</p>
<p>"What treaty?" I asked, with a leap of the heart.</p>
<p>"Oh, one between France, Japan and Russia. But that isn't the
point." (Ah, <i>was</i> it not, if he had known?) The thing is, it
would have been rather awkward, wouldn't it? if I hadn't got your
note out of the safe before the man came in, as he never took his
eyes off me, or out of the open safe, for a second."</p>
<p>"Thank God I wasn't too late!" I stammered, before I could keep
back the rushing words. "You mean, thank God he wasn't sooner,
don't you, darling?" amended Raoul.</p>
<p>"Yes, of course. How stupid I am!" I murmured.</p>
<p>All along, then, Godensky had meant to get my promise and
deceive me, for I had not even sent my note of defiance when this
trick was played. Had the treaty been missing, and Raoul disgraced,
Godensky would no doubt have vowed to me&mdash;if I'd lived to hear
his vows&mdash;that he had had no hand in the discovery. Fear of
the terrible man who had so nearly beaten me in the game made me
quiver even now. "You see," I went on, "I can think of nothing but
you, and my love for you. You'll never be jealous and make me
miserable again, will you, no matter what Count Godensky or any
other wretched creature may say of me to you?"</p>
<p>"I've listened to Godensky for the last time," said Raoul. "The
dog! He shall never come near me again."</p>
<p>"I hardly think he will try," I said. "I'm glad we're going to
be married soon. Do you know, I'm half inclined to do as you've
asked me sometimes, and promised you wouldn't ask again&mdash;leave
the stage. I want to rest, and just be happy, like other women. I
want love&mdash;and peace&mdash;and you."</p>
<p>"You shall have all, and for always," answered Raoul. "If only I
deserved you!"</p>
<p>"If only I deserved you!" I echoed.</p>
<p>Raoul would not let me say that. But he did not know. And I
trust that he never may; or not until a time, if such a time could
come, that he would forgive me all things, because we are one in a
perfect love.</p>

works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

     http://www.gutenberg.net/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
